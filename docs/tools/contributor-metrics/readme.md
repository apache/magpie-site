**Capability:** substrate:analytics

**Kind:** implementation

**Vendor:** GitHub

**Harness:** agnostic

Counts a contributor's activity on `<upstream>` over a window — PRs opened and merged, reviews, substantive reviews, issues filed, issues triaged, threads commented — splits it by area label, and applies the automated-work weights and pushback penalty defined in [`automated-contributions.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/nomination/automated-contributions.md).

It is the deterministic half of the contributor-growth skills.
`fetch` flags pushback *candidates* — a maintainer comment that contains a known pushback phrase — but never decides: the calling skill reads each candidate, confirms or rejects it by the rules in `automated-contributions.md`, classifies restatements, and hands the classes back to `score`.
Comment bodies never leave `fetch`; its output holds links and flags only.

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ run via `uv` (`uv run --directory tools/contributor-metrics contributor-metrics …`); stdlib-only, no third-party dependencies.
- **CLIs:** `uv`; `gh` — the script shells out to it for all GitHub access.
- **Credentials / auth:** an authenticated `gh` session (`gh auth status` must pass).
- **Network:** `api.github.com` via `gh`.

## Invocation

### `fetch`

```bash
contributor-metrics fetch --repo <upstream> --login <handle> --end YYYY-MM-DD --months 6 \
  [--phrases-file <file>] [--maintainers-file <file>] [--cache-dir <dir>] --out items.json
```

- `--phrases-file` — one extra pushback phrase per line (the project's `automated_pushback_phrases`), added to the generic list.
- `--maintainers-file` — whitespace-separated handles treated as maintainers in addition to `OWNER` / `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR` authors.
- `--cache-dir` — where fetched items are cached per repository, handle, window, phrases and roster; default `$TMPDIR/contributor-metrics-cache`. A second fetch with the same key reads the cache and makes no `gh` call. The cache holds links and flags only, never comment bodies.
  Weights, penalty and area prefix are applied by `score`, not cached, so changing them needs no refetch; anything that changes on GitHub after a fetch (a new label, a late comment) is picked up only with `--refresh`, or by deleting the cache directory.
- `--refresh` — ignore any cached result for this key and fetch again.
- `--repo` must be `owner/name`; anything else exits `2` before any `gh` call.

Every item is dated by the contributor's own activity and must fall inside `[since, end]`:

| Stream | Source | Dated by | Item kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRs authored | search `repo:<repo> type:pr author:<login> created:<since>..<end>` | creation; *merged* only when `mergedAt` ≤ `end` | `pr` |
| Issues filed | search `repo:<repo> type:issue author:<login> created:<since>..<end>` | creation | `issue` |
| Reviews | `contributionsCollection` between `since` and `end`, one item per reviewed PR | the first review in the window; *substantive* when any of those reviews has a body over 100 characters or a line comment — every reviewed PR is checked | `review` |
| Threads commented | search `repo:<repo> commenter:<login> created:<=<end> updated:>=<since>` | the contributor's first comment in the window; a thread with none is dropped | `thread` |
| Issues triaged | search `repo:<repo> type:issue commenter:<login> -author:<login> created:<=<end> updated:>=<since>` | as threads | `triage` |

Searches fetch at most 3 × 100 results; a stream that returned more is listed in `caps_hit`.
The 100 most recent threads of each kind are dated from their conversation; older ones keep their last-update date and are reported in `notes`.
The 50 most recent authored PRs and issues and the 20 most recent reviewed PRs get a conversation fetch for pushback candidates; older items, and triage threads beyond the thread budget, get none and keep full weight — the budget errs toward the contributor, as `automated-contributions.md` requires.
Item ids are per kind: the same PR can appear as `pr-N`, `review-N`, `thread-N` and `triage-N`, and the calling skill classifies each id it means to discount.
The search string is written to a tempfile and passed as `-F q=@<file>`, so a handle never reaches a shell argument.
Rate-limit and transient `gh` errors are retried with exponential backoff (up to six attempts); any other error exits `1`.

### `score`

```bash
contributor-metrics score --items items.json [--classes classes.json] [--weights weights.json] \
  [--area-prefix area:] [--since YYYY-MM-DD] --out metrics.json
```

- `--classes` — `{"<item id>": "P" | "R" | "C"}`, as confirmed by the calling skill; unknown ids and other values are reported in `notes` and ignored.
- `--weights` — any of `automated_contribution_weight`, `restatement_comment_weight`, `closed_after_pushback_weight`, `automated_pushback_penalty`; a missing, non-numeric or out-of-range value falls back to its default with a note.
- `--area-prefix` — the label prefix that marks a PR's area (the project's `area_label_prefix`).
- `--since` — score only a sub-window of what was fetched, e.g. the 6-month window from a 12-month fetch.

### `floors`

```bash
contributor-metrics floors --rows rows.json [--today YYYY-MM-DD] [--halflife 2] [--min-elected 5] --out floors.json
```

Proposes threshold floors from measured past nominations, for `contributor-calibrate`.
`rows.json` is a list of `{"target": "committer" | "pmc", "outcome": "elected" | "deferred" | "withdrawn", "vote_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "metrics": {"<metric>": <number>}, "capped": ["<metric>"]}`.

- Rows are weighted by recency, `0.5 ** (age_years / halflife)`; withdrawn rows are ignored.
- The weighted percentile is the smallest value whose cumulative weight reaches the percentile's share of the total weight.
- The floor is the weighted 25th percentile of elected rows, rounded down; when it is at or below the weighted median of deferred rows the metric is *evidence only* (floor `0`).
- A target with fewer than `--min-elected` elected rows gets no floors.
- A capped value is left out of that metric's distribution and counted in `excluded_capped`.

Output: `{"floors": {target: {metric: int}}, "evidence_only": {target: [metric]}, "no_floors_for": [target], "distribution": {...}, "notes": [...]}`.

## Output schema

`metrics.json`:

```json
{
  "window": {"since": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"},
  "weights": {"automated_contribution_weight": 0.25, "restatement_comment_weight": 0.0, "closed_after_pushback_weight": 0.0, "automated_pushback_penalty": 0.25},
  "notes": ["..."],
  "metrics": {
    "prs_opened": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "prs_merged": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "reviews_total": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "reviews_substantive": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "issues_filed": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "issues_triaged": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "threads_commented": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0}
  },
  "merge_rate": {"raw": null, "adjusted": null},
  "areas": [{"area": "area:x", "prs": {"raw": 0, "adjusted": 0.0, "share": 0.0}, "reviews": {"raw": 0, "adjusted": 0.0, "share": 0.0}}],
  "area_breadth": {"raw": 0, "adjusted": 0},
  "timeline": {"YYYY-MM": 0},
  "flagged": [{"id": "pr-1", "url": "...", "class": "P", "weight": 0.25, "penalised": true}],
  "caps_hit": []
}
```

- `discounted` is the sum of item weights; `penalty` is `automated_pushback_penalty` times the distinct threads classed `P` or `C` in that count; `adjusted` is `max(0, discounted − penalty)`.
- Area shares, area breadth and merge rate use item weights without the penalty.
- An area's share is its weight over **all** merged PRs (or reviews) in the window; work with no area label is reported as an `(unlabelled)` row, and a PR with two area labels counts toward both, so shares can add up to more than 100 %.
- The penalty is applied once per thread **in each count** the thread appears in — a pushed-back PR lowers opened, merged and threads-commented alike, because each count is compared with its own floor.
- `caps_hit` names every stream whose search returned more results than were fetched; its counts are floors.

## Failure modes

- Invalid handle → exit 2, no `gh` call.
- `gh` error → exit 1 with the `gh` stderr.
- A stream at its cap → listed in `caps_hit`; the counts it feeds are floors.
