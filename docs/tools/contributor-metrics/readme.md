**Capability:** substrate:analytics

**Kind:** implementation

**Vendor:** agnostic

**Harness:** agnostic

Counts a contributor's activity on `<upstream>` over a window — PRs opened and merged, reviews, substantive reviews, issues filed, issues triaged, threads commented — splits it by area label, and applies the automated-work weights and pushback penalty defined in [`automated-contributions.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/nomination/automated-contributions.md).

It is the deterministic half of the contributor-growth skills.
`fetch` flags pushback *candidates* — a maintainer comment that contains a known pushback phrase — but never decides: the calling skill reads each candidate, confirms or rejects it by the rules in `automated-contributions.md`, classifies restatements, and hands the classes back to `score`.
Comment bodies never leave `fetch`; its output holds links and flags only.

`fetch` reads change-request activity (PRs authored, reviews, PR threads) from the project's **code host** and issue activity (issues filed, triaged, commented) from its **tracker**, which may be a different system — see [Backends](#backends).

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ run via `uv` (`uv run --directory tools/contributor-metrics contributor-metrics …`); stdlib-only, no third-party dependencies.
- **Runtime (Jira backend):** the `jira-bridge` workspace package ([`tools/jira`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/jira/README.md)), whose stdlib-only REST client makes the Jira reads; `uv` installs it with the tool.
- **CLIs:** `uv`; `gh` — the GitHub backend shells out to it for all GitHub access.
- **Credentials / auth:** an authenticated `gh` session (`gh auth status` must pass). With a Jira tracker, the [`tools/jira`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/jira/README.md#configuration) conventions: `JIRA_API_TOKEN` and `JIRA_API_HOST` (or `token=` / `host=` lines in `~/.config/apache-magpie/jira-token`) and `JIRA_AUTH_SCHEME`, or none for anonymous reads. The token goes only to the host confirmed for it, over HTTPS, never across a redirect; for any other configured host the fetch reads anonymously and says so in `notes`.
- **Network:** `api.github.com` via `gh`; with a Jira tracker, the configured Jira host.

## Invocation

### `fetch`

```bash
contributor-metrics fetch --repo <upstream> --login <handle> --end YYYY-MM-DD (--months 6 | --since YYYY-MM-DD) \
  [--substantive-body-chars 100] [--substantive-line-comments 1] \
  [--phrases-file <file>] [--maintainers-file <file>] [--cache-dir <dir>] \
  [--tracker-config <project-config>/issue-tracker-config.md] [--tracker-login <account>] \
  [--tracker-maintainers-file <file>] --out items.json
```

- `--tracker-config` — the project's issue-tracker configuration; its `tracker_type`, `url` and `project_key` select the tracker backend (see [Backends](#backends)). Without it, the tracker is the code host.
- `--tracker-login` — the contributor's account on the tracker when it differs from their code-host handle (a Jira username); `--tracker-maintainers-file` — maintainer accounts on the tracker, for pushback candidates there.

- `--since` — the window start; it overrides `--months` for a window that is not a whole number of months, such as one trimmed to the repository's creation date.
  An invalid date, or one after `--end`, exits `2` before any `gh` call.
- `--substantive-body-chars` / `--substantive-line-comments` — a reviewed PR is *substantive* when one of the contributor's reviews on it has a body longer than the first or at least the second many line comments; defaults `100` and `1`.

- `--phrases-file` — one extra pushback phrase per line (the project's `automated_pushback_phrases`), added to the generic list.
- `--maintainers-file` — whitespace-separated handles treated as maintainers in addition to `OWNER` / `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR` authors.
- `--cache-dir` — where fetched items are cached per repository, handle, window, phrases, roster and substantive thresholds; default `$TMPDIR/contributor-metrics-cache`. A second fetch with the same key reads the cache and makes no `gh` call. The cache holds links and flags only, never comment bodies.
  Weights, penalty and area prefix are applied by `score`, not cached, so changing them needs no refetch; anything that changes on GitHub after a fetch (a new label, a late comment) is picked up only with `--refresh`, or by deleting the cache directory.
- `--refresh` — ignore any cached result for this key and fetch again.
- `--repo` must be `owner/name`; anything else exits `2` before any `gh` call.

Every item is dated by the contributor's own activity and must fall inside `[since, end]`:

| Stream | Source | Dated by | Item kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRs authored | search `repo:<repo> type:pr author:<login> created:<since>..<end>` | creation; *merged* only when `mergedAt` ≤ `end` | `pr` |
| Issues filed | search `repo:<repo> type:issue author:<login> created:<since>..<end>` | creation | `issue` |
| Reviews | `contributionsCollection` between `since` and `end`, one item per reviewed PR | the first review in the window; *substantive* when any of those reviews has a body over 100 characters or a line comment (or the configured thresholds) — every reviewed PR is checked | `review` |
| Threads commented | search `repo:<repo> commenter:<login> created:<=<end> updated:>=<since>` | the contributor's first comment in the window; a thread with none is dropped | `thread` |
| Issues triaged | search `repo:<repo> type:issue commenter:<login> -author:<login> created:<=<end> updated:>=<since>` | as threads | `triage` |

Searches fetch at most 3 × 100 results; a stream that returned more is listed in `caps_hit`.
The 100 most recent threads of each kind are dated from their conversation; older ones keep their last-update date and are reported in `notes`.
The 50 most recent authored PRs and issues and the 20 most recent reviewed PRs get a conversation fetch for pushback candidates; older items, and triage threads beyond the thread budget, get none and keep full weight — the budget errs toward the contributor, as `automated-contributions.md` requires.
Item ids are per kind: the same PR can appear as `pr-N`, `review-N`, `thread-N` and `triage-N`, and the calling skill classifies each id it means to discount.
The search string is written to a tempfile and passed as `-F q=@<file>`, so a handle never reaches a shell argument.
Rate-limit and transient `gh` errors are retried with exponential backoff (up to six attempts); any other error exits `1`.

### `score`

```bash
contributor-metrics score --items items.json [--classes classes.json] [--weights weights.json] \
  [--area-prefix area:] [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--timeline-kinds pr,issue,review,thread] --out metrics.json
```

- `--classes` — `{"<item id>": "P" | "R" | "C"}`, as confirmed by the calling skill; unknown ids and other values are reported in `notes` and ignored.
- `--weights` — any of `automated_contribution_weight`, `restatement_comment_weight`, `closed_after_pushback_weight`, `automated_pushback_penalty`; a missing, non-numeric or out-of-range value falls back to its default with a note.
- `--area-prefix` — the label prefix that marks a PR's area (the project's `area_label_prefix`).
- `--since` — score only a sub-window of what was fetched, e.g. the 6-month window from a 12-month fetch.
- `--timeline-kinds` — the item kinds the monthly `timeline` counts, comma-separated; default every kind.

### `floors`

```bash
contributor-metrics floors --rows rows.json [--today YYYY-MM-DD] [--halflife 2] [--min-elected 5] [--relaxation 0.75] --out floors.json
```

Proposes threshold floors from measured past nominations, for `contributor-calibrate`.
`rows.json` is a list of `{"target": "committer" | "pmc", "outcome": "elected" | "deferred" | "withdrawn", "vote_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "metrics": {"<metric>": <number>}, "capped": ["<metric>"]}`.

- Rows are weighted by recency, `0.5 ** (age_years / halflife)`; withdrawn rows are ignored.
- The weighted percentile is the smallest value whose cumulative weight reaches the percentile's share of the total weight.
- The floor is the weighted 25th percentile of elected rows multiplied by `--relaxation` (default `0.75`), rounded down.
  The relaxation is deliberate: the floors sit well below what the project has elected, so the lists built on them surface more people than the governing body would pick, and the decision stays with that body.
- When the unrelaxed weighted 25th percentile, rounded down, is at or below the weighted median of deferred rows, the metric is *evidence only* (floor `0`).
- A target with fewer than `--min-elected` elected rows gets no floors.
- A capped value is left out of that metric's distribution and counted in `excluded_capped`.

Output: `{"floors": {target: {metric: int}}, "evidence_only": {target: [metric]}, "no_floors_for": [target], "distribution": {...}, "relaxation": float, "notes": [...]}`.

## Backends

`fetch` has two sides, and a backend answers one side or both:

| Side | Contract | Streams | Backends |
|---|---|---|---|
| code host | [`contract:change-request`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/change-request/README.md#contributor-activity-queries-read-only) | PRs authored, reviews, PR threads | `github` |
| tracker | [`contract:tracker`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/tracker/README.md) | issues filed, issues triaged, issue threads | `github`, `jira` |

**GitHub for both (the default).** One pass over `<upstream>`, exactly as described above: threads are searched across issues and PRs together, and the output has no `backends` key.

**A Jira tracker.** When `--tracker-config` names `tracker_type: jira` (or `--tracker jira`), GitHub answers the code-host side — its thread search narrowed to `type:pr` — and the `jira` backend answers the tracker side from the configured project, for `--tracker-login`:

| Stream | Jira source | Dated by | Item kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| Issues filed | JQL `project = <KEY> AND reporter = <user> AND created` in the window | creation | `issue` |
| Issues triaged | an issue someone else reported on which the user changed `status`, `labels`, `component`, `priority`, `assignee`, `resolution` or `Fix Version`, or commented | the user's first such action in the window | `triage` |
| Threads commented | an issue the user commented on | the user's first comment in the window | `thread` |

Candidates for the last two come from every issue updated in the window (at most 1,000, most recent first; beyond that both streams are listed in `caps_hit` and a note says how many were not scanned) plus a direct `CHANGED BY <user> DURING (…)` search, which finds field changes on older issues too.
Jira has no author association, so only the tracker maintainer roster (`--tracker-maintainers-file`, else `--maintainers-file`) marks a pushback candidate; with no roster, none is flagged and a note says so.
Item ids carry the issue key (`issue-FOO-12`, `triage-FOO-12`, `thread-FOO-12`) and links point at `<url>/browse/<KEY>`.
The output gains `"backends": {"code_host", "tracker", "tracker_url", "tracker_project", "tracker_login"}`, and the cache key includes them.

The Jira URL and project key resolve as other skills resolve `<issue-tracker>`: from `issue-tracker-config.md`, overridden by `--jira-url` / `--jira-project`, else `ISSUE_TRACKER_URL` / `ISSUE_TRACKER_PROJECT`.
The HTTP client is [`tools/jira`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/jira/README.md)'s `jira_bridge.rest`, so the network surface stays in the tracker adapter.

## Output schema

`metrics.json`:

```json
{
  "window": {"since": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"},
  "weights": {"automated_contribution_weight": 0.25, "restatement_comment_weight": 0.0, "closed_after_pushback_weight": 0.0, "automated_pushback_penalty": 0.25},
  "notes": ["..."],
  "metrics": {
    "prs_opened": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "prs_merged": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "reviews_total": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "reviews_substantive": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "issues_filed": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "issues_triaged": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0},
    "threads_commented": {"raw": 0, "discounted": 0.0, "penalty": 0.0, "adjusted": 0.0}
  },
  "merge_rate": {"raw": null, "adjusted": null},
  "areas": [{"area": "area:x", "prs": {"raw": 0, "adjusted": 0.0, "share": 0.0}, "reviews": {"raw": 0, "adjusted": 0.0, "share": 0.0}}],
  "area_breadth": {"raw": 0, "adjusted": 0},
  "timeline": {"YYYY-MM": 0},
  "flagged": [{"id": "pr-1", "url": "...", "class": "P", "weight": 0.25, "penalised": true}],
  "caps_hit": []
}
```

- `discounted` is the sum of item weights; `penalty` is `automated_pushback_penalty` times the distinct threads classed `P` or `C` in that count; `adjusted` is `max(0, discounted − penalty)`.
- Area shares, area breadth and merge rate use item weights without the penalty.
- An area's share is its weight over **all** merged PRs (or reviews) in the window; work with no area label is reported as an `(unlabelled)` row, and a PR with two area labels counts toward both, so shares can add up to more than 100 %.
- The penalty is applied once per thread **in each count** the thread appears in — a pushed-back PR lowers opened, merged and threads-commented alike, because each count is compared with its own floor.
- `caps_hit` names every stream whose search returned more results than were fetched; its counts are floors.

## Failure modes

- Invalid handle → exit 2, no `gh` call.
- Invalid or incomplete tracker configuration, an unsupported `tracker_type`, or an invalid Jira username → exit 2, no request.
- `gh` error → exit 1 with the `gh` stderr; Jira error → exit 1 with the HTTP status.
- A stream at its cap → listed in `caps_hit`; the counts it feeds are floors.
