**Capability:** substrate:sandbox

**Harness:** agnostic

One exception to that tag:
[`sandbox-status-line.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-status-line.sh) is Claude Code only.
Every other script here is harness-agnostic.

This directory ships the moving pieces the framework's
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md) document
references. It is not a Python project (unlike the sibling tools
under `tools/cve-tool-vulnogram/` and `tools/gmail/oauth-draft/`) — these are
plain shell scripts plus a TOML manifest of pinned upstream
versions.

The clean-environment launcher [`agent-iso.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/agent-iso.sh) provides
harness-agnostic env isolation. It exposes four entry points, all sharing
the same `env -i` credential-strip core:

- **`claude-iso`** — launches Claude Code; additionally injects a one-shot
  `--settings` sandbox `allowRead` grant for the current repo (Claude-specific).
- **`opencode-iso`** — launches OpenCode with the same clean env; no settings
  grant (OpenCode takes its filesystem isolation from the OS-level sandbox).
- **`kiro-iso`** — launches Kiro CLI (the `kiro` name normalises to its
  `kiro-cli` binary) with the same clean env; like OpenCode, it takes its
  filesystem isolation from the OS-level sandbox (no `--settings` grant).
- **`agent-iso <cli>`** — launches *any* agentic CLI (`codex`, `cursor`,
  `gemini`, `aider`, …) with the same credential strip. The `--settings`
  injection is skipped for non-Claude CLIs, which take their filesystem
  isolation from the OS-level sandbox. The `-w` / `--worktree` flag is a
  Claude-only control flag and is stripped from the argv of non-Claude CLIs
  (it has no meaning for them). The Layer 0 env passthrough (including
  `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) is identical for every harness per
  [RFC-AI-0002 § Layer 0](https://magpie.apache.org/docs/rfcs/rfc-ai-0002/#layer-0--clean-env-wrapper);
  gating git push is a separate Layer 3 concern wired per-harness (see
  [`docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md)).

All entry points enforce layer 0 of the secure-agent posture regardless of
which harness drives the session. Harness-specific layers (the in-process
action guard, the `permissions.ask` confirmation list) are wired separately
per runtime — see [`docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md).

> ⚠️ **Generic harnesses (`agent-iso <cli>`) get Layer 0 only — no push gate.**
> Claude and OpenCode ship a Layer 3 push gate (agent-guard / `permissions.ask`),
> so a `git push` from those harnesses is gated. An arbitrary CLI launched via
> `agent-iso` (`codex`, `aider`, …) receives the live `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` with
> **nothing gating `git push`**. The credential-strip posture is identical across
> harnesses, but the *net* protection is weaker: a runtime with no Layer 3 adapter
> is responsible for providing its own push gate before it is trusted with the
> agent socket.

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Bash + coreutils — this directory is plain shell scripts plus a TOML manifest, not a Python project (the `pyproject.toml` ships only the test harness, which runs under Python 3.11+ via `uv`). `claude-term-bg.sh` uses `python3` / `python` for one heuristic and falls back to calm when absent.
- **CLIs:** `jq` (required by `check-tool-updates.sh` and the status-line scripts), `curl` (the update check), `git` (status line / git hooks), and `gh` (optional — status-line PR title). The secure setup itself installs the pinned `bubblewrap` and `socat` (via `apt-get`) and `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest` (via `npm` — the agent harness is intentionally unpinned; see [`pinned-versions.toml`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/pinned-versions.toml)).
- **Credentials / auth:** None for these helpers; the wrapped runtime authenticates separately. For authentication requiring environment variables, use the explicit opt-in below.
- **Network:** `api.github.com` and `www.dest-unreach.org` (the release checks in `check-tool-updates.sh`); the install step also reaches the apt and npm registries.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`pinned-versions.toml`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/pinned-versions.toml) | Machine-readable manifest of pinned upstream versions for the sandbox primitives `bubblewrap` and `socat`. Each entry carries a `released` date that satisfies the framework's 7-day cooldown convention. `claude-code` is deliberately **not** pinned — the agent harness installs at `@latest` so it always carries the newest permission-rule / sandbox / prompt-injection fixes. |
| [`check-tool-updates.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/check-tool-updates.sh) | Reads the manifest and reports upstream releases that are newer than the pin AND have themselves aged past the 7-day cooldown. Side-effect-free — no installs, no edits, no PRs. |
| [`agent-iso.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/agent-iso.sh) | Shell function to launch Claude Code with `env -i` and a tiny passthrough list, stripping every credential-shaped environment variable from the parent shell. The framework's "layer 0" of the secure setup. |
| [`sandbox-bypass-warn.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-bypass-warn.sh) | Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook (Bash matcher). Prints a bold-red banner to stderr whenever the model invokes the Bash tool with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. Belt-and-braces visibility for the sandbox-bypass permission prompt. Recommended user-scope (`~/.claude/settings.json`) so it fires across every session on the host. |
| [`sandbox-error-hint.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-error-hint.sh) | Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook (Bash matcher). Scans the tool's stdout + stderr for the three known sandbox-shaped error signatures (SSH agent / Yubikey unreachable, loopback port-bind blocked, docker / podman socket denied) and prints a `[sandbox-hint]` line pointing at the matching entry in [`docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting.md). Fail-open: any unexpected JSON shape exits silent. Recommended user-scope so the hint fires across every session. Complements `setup-isolated-setup-doctor` (the structured probe) by surfacing the catalog reference at the moment of failure, without the user having to remember the catalog exists. |
| [`sandbox-status-line.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-status-line.sh) | Claude Code `statusLine` helper, and the only one Magpie ships. **Claude Code only** — the one script in this directory that is not harness-agnostic: it is wired through Claude Code's `statusLine` setting, is fed Claude Code's statusLine payload on stdin, and reads Claude Code's `sandbox.enabled` schema. No other harness the framework supports has a status-line hook of that shape; Codex, Gemini, OpenCode and Kiro carry their sandbox posture in their own config and surface it, where they surface it at all, through their own UI. A harness that grows one gets its own helper — see [`docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md). Leads with the sandbox state — green `[sandbox]`, yellow `[sandbox-auto]` when `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` widens the blast radius, bold-red `[NO SANDBOX]` — read from `sandbox.enabled` in the active settings, project `settings.local.json` first, then project `settings.json`, then user-scope, mirroring Claude Code's own precedence, so in-session `/sandbox` toggles are reflected. Inside a linked git worktree the walk **leads with the main checkout** — that is where Claude Code scopes the project and where `/sandbox` persists the toggle, so it is the only file that can describe the session; reading `<cwd>` alone there falls through to user scope and paints a green `[sandbox]` on a session that has none. Layout-agnostic: worktrunk's `<repo>.<branch>/` siblings, `.claude/worktrees/<name>`, and plain `git worktree add` all resolve the same way, and a bare repo's worktrees — which have no main checkout at all — fall through to user scope rather than reading the bare directory's parent. Then the context that tells sessions apart: hash-coloured folder (stable per repo and worktree), git branch + dirty + ahead/behind (local only, no network), the branch's PR number and title (cached, gated by `gh`, silent without it), and the model. Every segment degrades to silence when its input is missing. Install user-scope. |
| [`claude-term-bg.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/claude-term-bg.sh) | **Opt-in quality-of-life helper (not a security control).** Keeps a calm baseline background and tints it only when Claude genuinely wants you to act (never while working, and never when it merely *finished* a turn), so a window you've tabbed away from can't sit blocked unnoticed. Distinguishes "blocked on a decision" from "finished and idle" — which look identical at the `Stop` event — via three signals across six hooks: `Stop` → `stop` (heuristic — tints only if the final assistant message reads as a question/request; a completion stays calm; needs `python3`/`python`, else defaults calm); `PreToolUse` (matcher `AskUserQuestion`) → `wait` (exact — a structured question was posed); `PostToolUse` (matcher `*`) → `reset` (calm while working, and clears the tint the instant you approve a permission prompt or answer a question); `Notification` → `notify` (tints for permission prompts only — the plain idle ping is a no-op so it can't wipe a pending question's tint); and `UserPromptSubmit` + `SessionStart` → `reset` (you replied / fresh session clears any stale tint). Writes the OSC escape to the Claude pty discovered by walking the process tree (hooks have no controlling tty); the only deterministic reset is an explicit `CLAUDE_RESET_BG` colour via OSC 11 (iTerm2 ignores OSC 111). Colours overridable via `CLAUDE_WAIT_BG` / `CLAUDE_RESET_BG`. Tested on iTerm2 + macOS; fail-soft elsewhere. See [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Waiting-for-input terminal tint*](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#waiting-for-input-terminal-tint). |
| [`sandbox-add-project-root.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-add-project-root.sh) | Adds the current adopter repo's project root (and, with `--all-worktrees`, every linked git worktree's working dir) as an explicit absolute path to `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` and `allowWrite` in the project-local, gitignored `<repo>/.claude/settings.local.json` — one entry per worktree, each in that worktree's own settings file. Defensive against [issue #197](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/197) — `allowRead: ["."]` does not in practice cover CWD because the harness pre-resolves the `.` literal away from the read side. Never modifies user-scope or committed project-scope. Idempotent, atomic, tolerant of missing prereqs. Invoked from `setup-isolated-setup-install`, `/magpie-setup` (adopt / upgrade / worktree-init), and the `post-checkout` git hook installed by `/magpie-setup adopt`. |
| [`git-global-post-checkout.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/git-global-post-checkout.sh) | Universal `post-checkout` git hook installed at `~/.claude/git-hooks/post-checkout` when the operator picks the **simple whole-user** flavour in `setup-isolated-setup-install`. Activated by `git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.claude/git-hooks/` so every `git checkout` / `git clone` / `git worktree add` across the host invokes it. Best-effort + idempotent + `\|\| true`: invokes `sandbox-add-project-root.sh` for any worktree with a `.claude/` directory. Trade-off documented in [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Per-project vs whole-user scope*](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#per-project-vs-whole-user-scope): `core.hooksPath` shadows per-repo `.git/hooks/*` across every repo on the host. The **dispatcher** flavour (below) supersedes this file. |
| [`git-hook-dispatcher.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/git-hook-dispatcher.sh) | Universal, basename-keyed git-hook **dispatcher** for the **whole-user dispatcher** flavour. Symlinked to every hook name under `~/.claude/git-hooks/`. For each git operation it runs the framework's own logic for that hook type (the `post-checkout` sandbox-allowlist sync) **and then chains through to the repo-local `.git/hooks/<name>`** (resolved via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, worktree-safe; `exec`-ed with original argv + inherited stdin so a failing local hook still aborts the git op). Restores per-repo hooks (prek / pre-commit / husky / hand-written) under global `core.hooksPath`; a repo with no local hook is a clean no-op. See [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Whole-user with the per-repo dispatcher*](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#whole-user-with-the-per-repo-dispatcher). |
| [`prek-shim.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-isolation/prek-shim.sh) | Transparent `prek` front installed as `~/.claude/bin/prek` (with `~/.claude/bin` prepended to PATH) for the whole-user dispatcher flavour. Rewrites **only** `prek install` — injecting `--git-dir "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)"` unless the caller already passed `--git-dir`, asked for `--help`, or is outside a git work tree — so prek's shim lands in the repo-local `.git/hooks/` where the dispatcher chains, instead of the shared `core.hooksPath` dir. Every other `prek` invocation passes through unchanged; no-op on hosts with no global `core.hooksPath`. |

## Usage at a glance

```bash
# Initial install (read pinned-versions.toml for the bubblewrap/socat pins):
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends bubblewrap=0.11.1-* socat=1.8.1.1-*
# claude-code is unpinned — always install the latest for the newest security fixes:
npm install -g --no-save @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest

# Source the wrapper into your shell:
source /path/to/magpie/tools/agent-isolation/agent-iso.sh

# Optional: make claude-iso the default `claude` (see docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md
# for the trade-off — the alias also strips env in non-tracker sessions):
alias claude='claude-iso'

# Launch a session with no inherited credentials:
cd ~/code/<tracker>
claude-iso

# For any other harness — same credential strip, no Claude-specific settings:
agent-iso codex [codex-args]
agent-iso cursor [cursor-args]
agent-iso gemini [gemini-cli-args]
# Or directly without sourcing:
bash /path/to/magpie/tools/agent-isolation/agent-iso.sh agent-iso codex [codex-args]

# Periodically (or via /schedule weekly), check for upgrade candidates:
bash /path/to/magpie/tools/agent-isolation/check-tool-updates.sh
```

## Explicit environment opt-in

`AGENT_ISO_ALLOW` names the additional variables the launcher may pass through, separated by spaces.
Values must already be set in the invoking shell or on the invocation line; naming a variable does not obtain a credential.
For example, with `GH_TOKEN` already set for a workflow that needs GitHub authentication:

```bash
AGENT_ISO_ALLOW=GH_TOKEN agent-iso <your-runtime-cli>
```

The same mechanism supports non-secret configuration such as a project ID or region.
Consult your runtime's adapter for required variables; the [Gemini authentication recipes](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/gemini.md#authentication-with-the-clean-environment-wrapper) show one mapping.
Credentials intentionally passed through are available to the runtime; this is an explicit exception to environment stripping, not a separate secret store.
Store persistent credentials under the runtime's home-directory convention, never in a project `.env` file.

`CLAUDE_ISO_ALLOW` remains supported for existing installations and all harnesses.
When `AGENT_ISO_ALLOW` is set, it replaces that legacy list; an explicitly empty value permits no additional variables.
Setting `KEY=value` alone does not bypass the strip.
The wrapper does not print values, and rejects invalid variable names before launching the runtime.
