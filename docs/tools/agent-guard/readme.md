**Capability:** substrate:action-guard

**Harness:** Claude Code, OpenCode, Kiro, Gemini CLI

A deterministic pre-execution guard dispatcher. It inspects every shell command
**before it runs** and **denies** the ones that would break a hard framework
rule — protections that must not depend on the model remembering a `SKILL.md`
instruction.

The guard *decisions* live in one harness-agnostic core (`dispatch()`); a thin
adapter per harness translates that harness's pre-tool hook to/from the core,
so every wired harness enforces an identical rule set from one source of truth:

- **Claude Code** — a [`PreToolUse`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)
  hook on the `Bash` matcher (the default, no-argument invocation).
- **OpenCode** — a [plugin](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/) on the
  `tool.execute.before` hook for the `bash` tool, which blocks a call by
  throwing (`agent-guard.py --opencode`). See [Wiring](#wiring).
- **Kiro CLI** — a [`preToolUse`](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/hooks) hook on the
  `execute_bash` matcher, which blocks a call when the hook exits `2`
  (`agent-guard.py --kiro`, reason on stderr). See [Wiring](#wiring).
- **Gemini CLI** — a [`BeforeTool`](https://geminicli.com/docs/hooks/reference/)
  hook on `run_shell_command`, using `--gemini` (exit `2`, reason on stderr).
  The repository's `.gemini/settings.json` wires this hook; snapshot
  adopters register it in their own settings. See [Gemini CLI](#gemini-cli).
- **Any other runtime** — the `--check` and `--exec` CLI modes let any
  harness or shell wrapper enforce guard rules without a harness-specific hook
  adapter. See [Harness-neutral path (any runtime)](#harness-neutral-path-any-runtime).

It is **stdlib-only** and is invoked directly as
`python3 <path>/agent_guard/__init__.py` (never via `uv run`) so it returns in a
few milliseconds for any command that is not a guarded `gh` / `git commit` /
`git push`.

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Python stdlib only — the hook runs as `python3 .../agent_guard/__init__.py` (3.11+), never via `uv`, so it needs no built/installed environment. The test suite runs under `uv run --directory tools/agent-guard --group dev pytest`.
- **CLIs:** `git` and `gh` — the guards shell out (via `ctx.run`) to inspect commits, branch state, and GitHub Actions runs. None otherwise.
- **Credentials / auth:** None. The guards read local `git` / `gh` state; `gh` must be on `PATH` for the `mark-ready` guard's Actions lookup.
- **Network:** None in the hot path; the `mark-ready` guard reaches `api.github.com` (via `gh`) when it checks for awaiting-approval Actions runs.

## Why a hook, not a rule in a SKILL.md

A rule written in a `SKILL.md` is a sentence the model reads at the start of a
session and is *asked* to keep in mind — through forty tool calls, a
compaction, and an issue body that says something the model finds persuasive.
Most of the time it does. "Most of the time" is fine for a style preference and
useless for a rule whose violation posts to a public repository under the
operator's name, because the cost is not evenly spread: one slip is a
notification to four maintainers who did not ask for it, or a CVE identifier
visible before the embargo lifts.

So these rules are not prose. They are Python, in a hook the harness calls
before the shell tool runs, and they get a veto. The guard sees the exact
command, decides, and either lets it through or refuses — a refused command is
**not run**: not posted, not retried, and not worked around by rephrasing. The
model is shown the reason and the deterministic fix (*"use a backtick
`` `login` `` instead of `@login`"*), so it corrects rather than guesses.

This is also the layer that does not care *why* a command was issued. A
prompt-injected instruction in an issue body and an honest mistake produce the
same `gh pr comment`, and the guard treats them identically — which is what you
want from something whose job is to be unpersuadable.

It is not a substitute for the sandbox and does not overlap with it. The
sandbox confines what a command can *reach*; the guard decides whether it
*runs at all*. A sandbox has nothing to say about a command that is entirely
within its rights, and a guard has nothing to say about a command reading
`~/.ssh`.

## Guards

**Bundled** (shipped with the engine — universal `git` hygiene, on for every
project):

| Guard | Blocks | Rule it enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `commit-trailer` | `git commit` whose message contains `Co-Authored-By:` | AGENTS.md: agents use a `Generated-by:` trailer, never co-author |
| `empty-rebase` | `git push --force[-with-lease]` of a branch with 0 commits over its base | an empty push to a PR head auto-closes it + revokes write |

**Skill-owned** (each lives in its skill's `guards/` dir, discovered the same
way — see [Contributing guards](#contributing-guards)):

| Guard | Owner skill | Blocks | Rule it enforces |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mention` | `pr-management-triage` | `gh pr comment` / `gh issue comment` that `@`-mentions anyone other than the PR/issue author; **any** `@`-mention in `gh pr edit --body[-file]` | denoise: author-directed feedback never pings maintainers; body edits stay silent. Exempt: the operator commenting on their **own** PR/issue (author == authenticated `gh` user), and the `MAGPIE_ALLOW_MENTIONS=1` override |
| `mark-ready` | `pr-management-triage` | adding `ready for maintainer review` while the PR head SHA has GitHub Actions runs awaiting approval | Golden rule 1b |
| `security-language` | `security-issue-fix` | a CVE id / security-fix language in a **public** `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit` title/body (not comments) | public-PR scrubbing |

A denied command is **not** posted/run; the model is shown the reason and the
deterministic fix (e.g. "use a backtick `` `login` `` instead of `@login`").

## Per-command overrides

Each guard is overridable by a **visible inline env assignment** so a maintainer
can consciously proceed:

```bash
MAGPIE_ALLOW_MENTIONS=1     gh pr comment 123 --body "@reviewer please take another look"
MAGPIE_ALLOW_COAUTHOR=1     git commit -m "…"            # not for AI co-authorship
MAGPIE_ALLOW_MARK_READY=1   gh pr edit 123 --add-label "ready for maintainer review"
MAGPIE_ALLOW_SECURITY_LANG=1 gh pr create --title "…"    # disclosure already public
MAGPIE_ALLOW_EMPTY_PUSH=1   git push --force …
MAGPIE_GUARD_OFF=1          <any command>                # disable all guards once
```

`MAGPIE_READY_LABEL` overrides the label string the `mark-ready` guard watches
for (default `ready for maintainer review`).

## Wiring

Install the `magpie-agent-guard` plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-agent-guard@apache-magpie
```

That is the whole installation. The plugin's manifest
([`plugins/magpie-agent-guard/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-agent-guard/.claude-plugin/plugin.json))
registers the `PreToolUse` hook itself and resolves the engine under
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, so the guard runs out of the installed plugin. **No
file is copied into any repository, no `settings.local.json` entry is written,
and a git worktree needs no seeding** — it is an ordinary checkout, and the
guard is active in it the moment the plugin is installed.

Skill-owned guards work the same way: the engine discovers every
`skills/<skill>/guards` in the framework tree it is running from, so a skill's
guards take effect where they live and nothing collects or syncs them.

The guard is its own plugin rather than a hook on `magpie` or on each family
plugin because Claude Code merges hooks from **every** enabled plugin — wiring it
into the families would run it once per enabled family on every `Bash` call. One
dedicated owner runs it exactly once, whatever else is installed.

### Snapshot adopters (`/magpie-setup`)

A project that vendors the framework as a snapshot rather than installing the
plugin wires the hook by hand, in the gitignored, per-machine
`.claude/settings.local.json`. Point it at the **snapshot's** engine, not at a
per-repository copy:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.apache-magpie/tools/agent-guard/src/agent_guard/__init__.py\"", "timeout": 30 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Every worktree already symlinks `.apache-magpie/` to the main checkout's
snapshot ([`worktree-init`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup/worktree-init.md)), so this path
resolves in a worktree without seeding anything else. `/magpie-setup upgrade`
refreshes the engine with the rest of the snapshot.

The user-scope secure setup installs the engine once at
`~/.claude/scripts/agent-guard.py` and wires it from `~/.claude/settings.json`;
that path is worktree- and repository-independent by construction. See
[`setup-isolated-setup-install`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md).

### OpenCode

The same engine backs OpenCode via the plugin in
[`opencode/plugin.js`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/agent-guard/opencode/plugin.js). OpenCode aborts a tool call whose
[`tool.execute.before`](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/) handler throws, so
the plugin forwards each `bash` command to `agent-guard.py --opencode` and
throws with the deny reason when the shared core denies it — the OpenCode
equivalent of a Claude `PreToolUse` deny.

Drop the plugin into OpenCode's plugin directory (`.opencode/plugin/` in the
project, or `~/.config/opencode/plugin/` globally):

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/plugin
ln -s "<framework>/tools/agent-guard/opencode/plugin.js" .opencode/plugin/agent-guard.js
```

The plugin locates the engine at `.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py` under the
worktree by default — so a repo already wired for Claude Code needs no second
copy of the script — and honours `MAGPIE_AGENT_GUARD=/abs/path/agent-guard.py`
to point elsewhere. Because both harnesses call `dispatch()`, the bundled and
skill-contributed guards, the `MAGPIE_*` overrides, and the deny reasons are
byte-for-byte identical across the two; nothing about a guard is harness-aware.

### Kiro CLI

The same engine backs [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/hooks) via its
`preToolUse` hook. Kiro pipes the hook event
(`{"tool_name": "execute_bash", "tool_input": {"command": …}, "cwd": …}`) to
the hook command on stdin and **blocks** the tool call when that command exits
`2`, returning its stderr to the model — so `agent-guard.py --kiro` matches the
shell tool, runs the shared core, and on a deny writes the reason to stderr and
exits `2`, the Kiro equivalent of a Claude `PreToolUse` deny.

Register it in the agent configuration's `hooks` field
([reference](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/custom-agents/configuration-reference#hooks-field)):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "execute_bash",
        "command": "python3 \"${MAGPIE_AGENT_GUARD:-.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py}\" --kiro"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The engine is one shared, harness-agnostic file (`--kiro` only selects the I/O
adapter). On a repo already wired for Claude Code it lives at
`.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py`, so the hook reuses it; a **Kiro-only** adopter
(no `.claude/`) points `MAGPIE_AGENT_GUARD` at wherever the engine is installed.
Note: `/magpie-setup` currently installs the engine only on the Claude path — a
general installer that drops it for non-Claude-only adopters is a pending
follow-up (see [`docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/add-a-harness.md)).

Because every harness calls `dispatch()`, the bundled and skill-contributed
guards, the `MAGPIE_*` overrides, and the deny reasons are identical to the
Claude Code and OpenCode paths — verified end-to-end: with this hook wired,
Kiro refuses a `Co-Authored-By` commit (quoting the `commit-trailer` reason and
leaving the commit uncreated) while a clean commit proceeds.

### Gemini CLI

The repository's [`.gemini/settings.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/.gemini/settings.json) wires
the `--gemini` adapter to Gemini CLI's `BeforeTool` event.
Start Gemini from the checkout root; the command uses `GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR`
to resolve the engine without a machine-specific path.

The [`setup-isolated-setup-install`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md)
skill registers the adapter in the adopter's workspace `.gemini/settings.json`.
It resolves the existing extension, snapshot, or framework checkout and merges
one `magpie-agent-guard` entry while preserving unrelated hooks.
See [the Gemini install lifecycle](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/gemini.md#install)
for path selection, trust, and verification.

For manual registration, merge this entry into existing hooks and replace the
example path with the resolved framework directory, quoted for the shell and
encoded as JSON:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "BeforeTool": [
      {
        "matcher": "^run_shell_command$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "name": "magpie-agent-guard",
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/magpie/tools/agent-guard/src/agent_guard/__init__.py\" --gemini"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Gemini supplies `tool_input.command` and `cwd` on stdin.
The adapter calls `dispatch()` and returns exit `2` with the denial reason on
stderr; permitted commands return `0` silently.
The adapter tests cover CLI routing, preservation of core decisions, workspace-aware
Git checks, malformed input, and execution of the project settings' hook command.
An offline probe of Gemini CLI 0.59.0 also loaded those settings through its
native settings loader and registered and executed the hook, recognizing its
denial even from a checkout path containing spaces.

This preserves the shared engine's fail-open behavior for malformed input.
A missing hook executable or interpreter can also leave the session running
with a warning, so verify a known denial after installation.
The hook covers shell commands; native file and MCP tools still need their
own permissions, and shell execution still needs an OS sandbox.
See the [harness contract](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/adapters/gemini.md).

### Harness-neutral path (any runtime)

For runtimes without a wired pre-tool hook adapter, the engine ships two
CLI modes that allow enforcement without a harness-specific adapter:

**`--check <command…>`** — inspects the command and reports allow/deny without
executing it. Exits `0` on allow (silent), `2` on deny (reason on stdout), or
`64` (usage) when no command is supplied — `64` is deliberately distinct from
the deny code so a caller testing `$? -eq 2` never mistakes a misinvocation for
a policy block. Shell scripts and wrappers can inspect the exit code before
proceeding:

```bash
reason=$(python3 /path/to/agent-guard.py --check git push origin main)
if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
  echo "blocked: $reason" >&2
  exit 1
fi
git push origin main
```

**`--exec <command…>`** — inspects the command then exec-replaces this process
with it on allow. On deny it prints the reason to stderr and exits `2`. The
exec'd command's own exit code and output are indistinguishable from a direct
invocation, making `--exec` suitable as a transparent wrapper:

```bash
# Shell alias in project .envrc / .bashrc. Safe: aliases are invisible to the
# execvp that --exec uses, so the bare name resolves to the real binary.
alias git='python3 /path/to/agent-guard.py --exec git'
alias gh='python3 /path/to/agent-guard.py --exec gh'

# Wrapper script named 'git' earlier on $PATH than the real one. It MUST exec
# the real git by ABSOLUTE path — passing the bare name 'git' would make --exec
# re-resolve it through $PATH, find this wrapper again, and loop. Adjust the
# path to your real git (`command -v git` with this wrapper off $PATH).
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec python3 "${MAGPIE_AGENT_GUARD:-/path/to/agent-guard.py}" --exec /usr/bin/git "$@"
```

Both modes use the same `dispatch()` core as the Claude Code and OpenCode
adapters, so the guard decisions are identical regardless of which path you use.
Both are **fail-open**: a guard glitch never hard-blocks the user (and `--exec`
bounds any accidental wrapper recursion instead of looping forever).

Locate the engine at `agent_guard/__init__.py` inside the framework snapshot
(`.apache-magpie/tools/agent-guard/src/agent_guard/__init__.py` in an adopter
tree) or at the path `/magpie-setup` ships it to (`.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py`
for Claude Code setups — the file is the same and works for all three modes).

## Contributing guards

The hook is **wired once**. Beyond the two bundled guards, additional guards are
discovered at runtime from every `*.py` in a discovered guard directory — any
directory listed in `$MAGPIE_GUARD_DIRS` (colon-separated), then every
`skills/*/guards` in the framework tree the engine runs from, then the
`guards.d` sibling of the running script. **No `settings.json` change and no
install step is needed to add a guard.**

A skill owns its guards by shipping them under `skills/<skill>/guards/*.py`.
The engine discovers them there — it resolves the framework tree it is running
from and scans every `skills/*/guards` in it, alongside its own bundled
`guards.d`. Nothing collects or copies them, so a new guard is live as soon as
the framework is. (A single self-contained copy of the engine, with no framework
tree above it, sees only its own `guards.d` and whatever `$MAGPIE_GUARD_DIRS`
names.) A guard file is **import-free** — it defines:

- `TRIGGERS` — optional list of command families to pre-filter on (`"gh"`,
  `"git:commit"`, `"git:push"`, …); omit to run on every guarded command.
- `guard(ctx)` — returns a deny-reason string to block, or `None` to allow.
  `ctx` is the `GuardContext`: `ctx.argv`, `ctx.raw`, `ctx.override(*names)`,
  `ctx.gh_subcommand()`, `ctx.opt(short, long)`, `ctx.gh_body(...)`,
  `ctx.mentions(text)`, `ctx.positional_after(token)`, `ctx.repo_flag()`,
  `ctx.run(args)`, `ctx.ready_label`.

A guard file that fails to import is skipped (a broken contribution never breaks
the shell). See `guards.d/no_verify_commit.py` for the template, and
`skills/pr-management-triage/guards/` for real examples.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --directory tools/agent-guard --group dev pytest
```

Table-driven tests feed synthetic `PreToolUse` events to `dispatch()` and assert
allow vs. deny. The `gh` / `git` lookups the guards make are monkeypatched.
