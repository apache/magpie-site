**Capability:** substrate:release

**Harness:** agnostic

Builds, lints and compares **reproducible source archives**.
The archive is always derived from `git archive <ref>`, so only tracked files at the tag are packed and the repository's `.gitattributes` `export-ignore` rules decide what stays out.
On top of that stream the tool applies every rule from [reproducible-builds.org § Archive metadata](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/archives/), so a Release Manager and a voter on different machines, with different `git`, `tar`, `zip` and `gzip` versions, get **byte-identical** output from the same tag.

This is what `release-rc-cut` emits for the source artefact, what `release-verify-rc`'s reproducibility step rebuilds and compares against the staged RC, and what an ASF adopter needs before it can request [automated release signing](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#automated-release-signing) (which requires artefacts that "can be built reproducibly" and are re-validated "bit-by-bit identical" on trusted hardware).
See [`docs/release-management/reproducibility.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/release-management/reproducibility.md) for how the pieces fit.

## The rules it implements

| # | reproducible-builds.org rule | Standard-tool equivalent | What the module does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | File modification times | `tar --mtime="@${SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH}"`, `touch --date="@${SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH}"` | Every member gets one mtime: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, defaulting to the committer timestamp of the ref (`git log -1 --format=%ct`), the one value every builder of the same tag agrees on. |
| 2 | File ordering | `tar --sort=name`, or `find … \| LC_ALL=C sort -z` | Members are emitted in per-directory byte order, independent of the packer's locale and filesystem. |
| 3 | Ownership | `--owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner` | uid/gid `0`, empty user and group names. |
| 4 | Permissions / umask | `--mode=a=rX,u+w` | Files `0644`, executables and directories `0755`, setuid/setgid/sticky dropped. Symlinks are always packed as `0777`: `lstat` reports them as `0755` on macOS and `0777` on Linux, and the SWHID uses git's fixed `120000` for them, so the platform that packed the archive leaves no trace. |
| 5 | PAX headers | `--pax-option=exthdr.name=%d/PaxHeaders/%f,delete=atime,delete=ctime` | No `atime` / `ctime` headers; `check` also catches the PID-bearing `PaxHeaders.<pid>` names GNU tar emits under `POSIXLY_CORRECT`. |
| 6 | gzip | `gzip -n` | gzip header mtime `0`, no embedded filename, no extra field, no comment. |
| 7 | zip extra attributes | `zip -X`, unzip with `TZ=UTC` | No "extra field" per member, no comments, DOS timestamps computed in UTC from `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, Unix create-system so the normalised modes round-trip. |

`ar` deterministic mode (`ARFLAGS=Dcvr`, `ranlib -D`) and `cpio` are the same page's rules for *binary* artefacts; they belong in the adopter's build command, not here — `release-build.md § Convenience artefacts` records how the project applies them.

Three more fixes the page does not list but that vary between machines and would otherwise leak into the bytes:

| Fix | Why |
|---|---|
| `git -c core.autocrlf=false -c core.eol=lf archive` | `git archive` applies the same conversions as a checkout, so a builder with `core.autocrlf=true` exports different bytes for `text` files. The repository's committed `.gitattributes` (`export-ignore`, `export-subst`, `text`, `eol`) stay in force; only the builder's personal config is neutralised. |
| The archive writer is this module, not the local `tar` / `zip` / `git` | `git archive`'s zip and tar output changed between git versions (compression, PAX handling); two voters on different versions get different bytes from the same tag. Python's `tarfile` / `zipfile` output is a function of the inputs above. |
| The commit id travels with the archive | As `git archive` does it: a global PAX header `comment=<commit>` in tar, the archive comment in zip. Provenance a reader can extract without the planning issue; `check` accepts exactly that comment and flags any other. |

And one identifier the page does not cover, which turns "same bytes" into "same tree": the **SWHID** (below).

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ (stdlib only, no third-party dependencies); run via `uv run --project tools/reproducible-archive` or as a plain `python3 <file>`.
- **CLIs:** `git` on `PATH` for `build` and `epoch`; `check`, `compare` and `recipe` work on archive files alone.
- **Credentials / auth:** None.
- **Network:** None — runs fully offline on the local clone and local archive files.

## How to use

From the framework root (`<framework>` is `.apache-magpie/` in an adopting project, `.` in the framework checkout):

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/reproducible-archive repro-archive --help
```

or, with no `uv` at all:

```bash
python3 <framework>/tools/reproducible-archive/src/reproducible_archive/__init__.py --help
```

### `build` — a source archive that is a function of the tag alone

```bash
repro-archive build --ref 2.11.0-rc1 --format tar.gz \
    --prefix apache-foo-2.11.0 -o apache-foo-2.11.0-source.tar.gz \
    --origin https://github.com/apache/foo
# wrote apache-foo-2.11.0-source.tar.gz
# commit 1890a13d…
# SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH 1758326400
# sha512 …
# swhid_rev swh:1:rev:1890a13d…;origin=https://github.com/apache/foo
# swhid_dir swh:1:dir:3b9f…;origin=https://github.com/apache/foo;anchor=swh:1:rev:1890a13d…
# swhid_dir_note differs from the repository tree swh:1:dir:7c1e… (export-ignore / export-subst / eol attributes applied)
# origin https://github.com/apache/foo
```

`--format zip` produces the ZIP equivalent. `--epoch N` overrides `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (the environment variable is honoured too); the default is the committer timestamp of `--ref`. `--origin` is the repository URL recorded as the SWHID origin qualifier. The command refuses to run outside a git repository, refuses a ref it cannot resolve, and refuses a ZIP for an epoch before 1980 (the DOS timestamp cannot encode it).

Record every printed line on the planning issue: a voter needs the commit and epoch to rebuild, the sha512 to compare bytes, and the SWHID to compare trees — with each other and with what ATR computed.

### `check` — lint an archive against the checklist

```bash
repro-archive check apache-foo-2.11.0-source.tar.gz --epoch 1758326400
# PASS gzip-header          mtime 0, no filename (gzip -n)
# PASS file-ordering        members are in per-directory byte order
# PASS modification-times   single mtime 1758326400
# PASS ownership            uid/gid 0, no user/group names
# PASS permissions          every mode is a=rX,u+w
# PASS pax-headers          no atime/ctime/PID headers
# SKIP zip-extra-fields     not a zip
```

Exit code `1` on any `FAIL`. `--json` prints the same table as a list of `{name, status, detail}`. `--epoch` additionally asserts the single mtime *is* the expected `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`; without it the check only requires that every member share one mtime. It works on any `.tar`, `.tar.gz` or `.zip`, not only ones this tool built, so it doubles as a lint for an archive produced by a project's own build.

### `compare` — did the voter get the same bytes?

```bash
repro-archive compare staged/apache-foo-2.11.0-source.tar.gz rebuilt.tar.gz --require-identical
```

Three verdicts, in decreasing strength:

| Verdict | Meaning | Exit code |
|---|---|---|
| `identical` | Byte-for-byte the same file. The bar ASF automated release signing sets for validation on trusted hardware. | `0` |
| `content-identical` | Every member's bytes, type, normalised mode and link target match; only archive metadata differs (timestamps, owners, ordering, extra fields, compression). What a voter gets from a plain `git archive` with a different `git` version. The metadata differences are listed. | `0`, or `1` with `--require-identical` |
| `differs` | Members were added, removed or changed; each is listed. The artefact does not match the tag. | `2` |

`--json` prints the `Comparison` record.

### `recipe` — the same steps with GNU tar / Info-ZIP

```bash
repro-archive recipe --ref 2.11.0-rc1 --format tar.gz --prefix apache-foo-2.11.0 -o apache-foo-2.11.0-source.tar.gz
```

Prints the shell recipe from reproducible-builds.org (GNU tar ≥ 1.28 and `gzip -n`, or `LC_ALL=C sort` + `zip -X` under `TZ=UTC`) adapted to a `git archive` input, for a Release Manager who prefers to run the standard tools. It ends with the `check` invocation that verifies the result. The Python path and the shell path apply the same rules; only the Python path is guaranteed byte-identical across tool versions.

### `swhid` — the Software Heritage identifier of what shipped

```bash
repro-archive swhid apache-foo-2.11.0-source.tar.gz --ref 2.11.0-rc1 --origin https://github.com/apache/foo
# swhid_rev      swh:1:rev:1890a13d…;origin=https://github.com/apache/foo
# swhid_repo_dir swh:1:dir:7c1e…;origin=https://github.com/apache/foo;anchor=swh:1:rev:1890a13d…
# swhid_dir      swh:1:dir:3b9f…;origin=https://github.com/apache/foo;anchor=swh:1:rev:1890a13d…
```

A [SWHID](https://swhid.org/) (ISO/IEC 18670:2025) directory identifier is computed from names, modes and contents alone, exactly as git computes a tree id, so it is intrinsic to the files: timestamps, ownership, compression and the archive format play no part, a `.tar.gz` and a `.zip` of the same tree carry the same `swh:1:dir:`, and a voter recomputes it from the staged bytes without git. ATR computes the same value for a candidate at compose time, and it equals `git rev-parse <ref>^{tree}` (`swhid_repo_dir`) unless `.gitattributes` altered the export (`export-ignore`, `export-subst`, `text` / `eol`) — in which case the difference is itself the record of what was left out. `build` prints all three plus a one-line note saying which case applies; the `origin` and `anchor` qualifiers follow the SWH specification. The identifier is computed in memory from the archive members and is tested against `git write-tree` over the extracted tree, so it agrees with `asfswhid` / `swh identify` by construction.

`check --swhid swh:1:dir:…` asserts the archive content against a recorded value (qualifiers are ignored), and `compare` reports both archives' SWHIDs so "different bytes, same tree" is visible at a glance. Record `swhid_dir`, `swhid_rev` and the origin next to the commit on the planning issue: `release-vote-draft` puts them in the `[VOTE]`, `release-verify-rc` checks them, and a convenience artefact can name the source SWHID it was built from.

### `epoch` — the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` of a ref

```bash
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH="$(repro-archive epoch --ref 2.11.0-rc1)"
```

Use it to feed the same timestamp into a binary build (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is honoured by most build tools that embed dates) so the binary reproducibility check in `release-verify-rc` has a fixed reference.

## Embedding the script

`src/reproducible_archive/__init__.py` is a single stdlib-only file with a `__main__` guard. Copy it verbatim into a CI workflow, a release script, or a project that does not adopt the rest of Magpie:

```bash
python3 reproducible_archive.py build --ref "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" --prefix "apache-foo-${VERSION}" \
    --format tar.gz -o "apache-foo-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz"
```

The ASF automated-release-signing workflow template in [`projects/_template/workflows/release-candidate.yml`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/workflows/release-candidate.yml) does exactly that.

## Wiring

- `release-rc-cut` Step 2 emits `repro-archive build` as the source-artefact build command whenever `release-build.md § Source archive` sets `source_archive_method: git-archive` (the default), and Step 2b emits the optional `check` + rebuild-and-`compare` self-check.
- `release-verify-rc` Step 9 rebuilds from the tag with `build` and runs `compare` against the staged artefact; `--require-identical` when the adopter has `automated_release_signing: enabled`.
- The workspace pre-commit hooks (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`) pick the project up from the root `pyproject.toml` `[tool.uv.workspace] members` list.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --project tools/reproducible-archive python -m pytest
```

Every rule has a positive case (the builder applies it) and a negative case (`check` catches an archive that violates it); `compare` is exercised on all three verdicts; and `build` is shown to be a function of the tag alone: two builds at different wall-clock times under a different umask are byte-identical.
