**Capability:** substrate:sandbox

**Harness:** agnostic

A dispatcher for **fixed, policy-scoped forge operations**, so an agent session
needs *one* allowlist entry instead of a dozen wildcard `ask` rules.

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ via `uv`. The package itself is stdlib-only.
- **CLIs:** the `gh` CLI on `PATH`, authenticated for the repositories the policy
  names. Every operation shells out to it; the dispatcher runs nothing else.
- **Credentials:** whatever `gh` already uses (`~/.config/gh/`). This tool reads
  no credential of its own and stores none.
- **Network:** only what `gh` needs — `github.com` / `api.github.com`.
- **Configuration:** a policy TOML (see *Configuration*). Without one, every
  operation refuses.

## Why

[RFC-AI-0002 Layer 3](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/rfcs/RFC-AI-0002.md) forces confirmation on every
outward-visible action:

```json
"ask": [ "Bash(gh issue edit *)", "Bash(gh issue comment *)",
         "Bash(gh issue close *)", "Bash(gh api * -X *)", … ]
```

The wildcard is doing the work, and it is also the cost. `gh issue edit *` covers
an unbounded argument surface — `--add-label`, `--body`, `--repo <somewhere
else>` — so a human has to read every invocation to know what it does. On a
sweep that touches thirty trackers, that is a hundred prompts, and the hundredth
gets the same attention as the first. Prompt fatigue is itself a security
problem.

This tool removes the wildcard rather than the confirmation. Each operation is a
**closed shape**: a name, typed parameters, and a builder that returns an argv
list. The repository comes from policy, not the command line. Labels, milestones,
assignees, board columns and close reasons must be values the policy declares.
Because the effect set is bounded by construction, the dispatcher can be
`allow`ed once instead of `ask`ed every time.

## What it actually guarantees

Being precise, because a security tool that overstates itself is worse than none:

- **A parameter can never become a command.** Builders return `list[str]`, executed
  with `subprocess.run(..., shell=False)`. There is no string interpolation
  anywhere in the path, so `1; rm -rf /` is simply an invalid issue number.
- **A parameter can never become a flag.** Any parameter starting with `-` is
  refused before validation, which closes flag-injection into `gh`.
- **The repo is not addressable.** No operation takes a repository parameter; it
  is read from policy. An operation cannot be pointed at another repository, and
  parameters that reach an API *path* — repo paths and git refs — refuse `..`,
  so none of them can walk out of the pinned repository either.
- **Body content is free; body *location* and *timing* are not.** Comment bodies
  may contain anything — backticks, `$(…)`, newlines — because content is never
  interpolated into a command. What is constrained is which file may be read and
  when. The file must resolve inside the configured workspace, that workspace
  must be owned by you and closed to group and world, and a symlink is refused
  (`O_NOFOLLOW`, plus a realpath check for the parents). The dispatcher then
  **reads the bytes itself and pipes them to `gh` on stdin**, so there is exactly
  one open. Handing `gh` a path would leave a window between the check and the
  send in which the file could be swapped; the bytes that were validated are the
  bytes that get published.
- **Writes cannot be reached through the read entry point.** `vetted-op-read`
  refuses any operation with `writes=True` *before* it consults the policy or
  looks at `--caller`, so the refusal cannot be argued out of it by argv. This
  is the one property that makes an unattended `allow` defensible — see below.
- **GraphQL is named, not written.** `gh api graphql` normally takes a query as a
  string — the widest surface `gh` offers. Here a caller names one of the
  documents shipped in [`queries/`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/tools/vetted-ops/src/vetted_ops/queries), the dispatcher
  supplies the text, and `owner`/`name` come from policy. A caller can choose
  among the allowlisted queries; it cannot write one, and cannot re-aim one at
  another repository.
- **The catalogue is closed.** Widening the surface means editing
  [`ops.py`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/vetted-ops/src/vetted_ops/ops.py) — a reviewed code change, not a runtime
  decision.

### The boundary is the entry point, not `--caller`

**Per-caller scoping is least-privilege, not a security boundary.** The policy
declares which operations each caller may run, and `--caller` is required. But
within one agent session the agent is a single principal that chooses what to
pass as `--caller`. This protects against *the wrong skill reaching for the wrong
operation* — a real and common failure, especially under prompt injection, where
a hostile issue body talks a read-only triage pass into closing something. It
does **not** stop a determined agent, and a permission rule must never be
written as though it does. Concretely: allowlisting `vetted-op *` on the strength
of a read-only caller name grants **every** operation in the catalogue, because
the next invocation can name a different caller.

What *can* be bound is the **entry point**, because a permission rule keys on the
command and argv cannot change which binary is running. Hence two console
scripts over one catalogue:

| Entry point | Can write? | Intended permission |
|---|---|---|
| `vetted-op-read` | never — refused before policy is consulted | `allow` |
| `vetted-op` | yes, subject to policy | `ask` (or unlisted) |

That split is what lets the read path lose its prompts without the write path
losing its gate, and it is why `--caller` repeated twice is an error rather than
a last-wins convenience: argparse keeps the last occurrence, so repetition would
let a command match a rule written against a read-only prefix while resolving to
a privileged caller.

For writes, the confirmation the harness puts in front of `vetted-op` is still
doing the work. A finer boundary — per-skill scope bound by the runtime — needs
something no portable mechanism offers yet: plugin manifests cannot declare
permissions, and `permissionMode` is unsupported for plugin-shipped agents. The
closest primitive is a subagent with a restricted `tools` list, which is **Claude
Code-specific**. See
[`tools/spec-loop/specs/vetted-command-surface.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/spec-loop/specs/vetted-command-surface.md)
for that trajectory.

**The policy file is only as protected as the filesystem makes it.** Rewriting
the policy cannot reach a write through `vetted-op-read` — that refusal ignores
the config entirely — but it can widen which repository the *reads* point at. If
the policy lives somewhere the agent's shell can write, treat its contents as
advisory rather than enforced.

**This is not a substitute for the sandbox.** It reduces prompt volume at Layer 3.
Layers 0–2 are unchanged and still carry the load.

## Configuration

Adopter-owned, at
`.apache-magpie-overrides/tools/vetted-ops/config.toml` by default:

```toml
# Body files must resolve inside this directory.
workspace = "/tmp/agent-scratch"

[repos]
tracker  = "acme/tracker"
upstream = "acme/product"

[values]
labels        = ["needs triage", "cve allocated", "pr merged"]
upstream_labels = ["ready for maintainer review", "area:scheduler"]  # issues *and* PRs
milestones    = ["1.2.3", "1.3.0"]
assignees     = ["alice", "bob"]
issue_states  = ["open", "closed", "all"]
pr_states     = ["open", "closed", "merged", "all"]
close_reasons = ["completed", "not planned"]

board_project_id      = "PVT_kwDO…"   # ProjectV2 node id
board_status_field_id = "PVTSSF_…"    # its Status field id

[values.board_columns]           # column name -> single-select option id
"Assessed"      = "aee65beb"
"CVE allocated" = "aae2beb3"

[callers]                        # caller -> operations it may run
"security-issue-sync"   = ["issue-view", "issue-comments", "issue-add-label",
                           "issue-set-milestone", "issue-comment", "comment-update"]
"security-issue-triage" = ["issue-view", "issue-comments"]
"pr-management-triage"  = ["pr-list", "pr-view", "pr-checks", "gql-pr-liveness",
                           "pr-add-label", "pr-remove-label", "pr-draft", "pr-ready",
                           "pr-comment", "pr-update-branch", "run-rerun-failed",
                           "workflow-approve"]
"pr-management-code-review" = ["pr-view", "pr-diff", "pr-comments", "pr-reviews",
                               "gql-pr-review-threads", "pr-review-approve",
                               "pr-review-request-changes", "pr-review-comment"]
"pr-management-stats"   = ["pr-list", "pr-view", "gql-pr-review-threads"]
"issue-triage"          = ["repo-issue-view", "repo-issue-comments", "repo-issue-list",
                           "repo-issue-add-label", "repo-issue-remove-label",
                           "repo-issue-comment"]
"issue-stale-sweep"     = ["repo-issue-list", "repo-issue-view", "repo-issue-comment",
                           "repo-issue-close", "repo-issue-reopen"]
"issue-backlog-stats"   = ["repo-issue-list"]
"license-compliance-audit" = ["repo-view", "repo-tree", "repo-file"]
"flaky-test-triage"     = ["run-list", "run-view", "pr-view"]
"release-verify-rc"     = ["release-list", "release-view", "tags", "repo-file"]
"contributor-nomination" = ["user-profile", "pr-list", "repo-issue-list"]
"mentoring-welcome"     = ["repo-issue-view", "repo-issue-comment", "pr-view"]
```

`mentoring-welcome` needs no operation of its own: it works on upstream issues
and PRs, which the issue and PR families already cover. A family earns new
operations only when it has a shape the catalogue lacks.

Grant the narrowest set that lets a skill finish its job: `pr-management-stats`
is a read-only dashboard, so it gets no write operation at all, and a
prompt-injection payload in a PR title cannot talk it into one.

The policy is never supplied on the command line: a caller cannot widen its own
policy.

## CLI

```bash
vetted-op list-ops                          # the catalogue
vetted-op policy                            # resolved policy, as JSON
vetted-op --caller <name> <operation> [param …]
vetted-op --caller <name> <operation> [param …] --dry-run   # print argv, run nothing
```

Exit codes: `0` ok, `2` usage, `3` refused by policy or validation, `4` the
underlying command failed.

## Wiring it into settings

Replace the wildcard `ask` rules with one `allow` entry, and keep an `ask` on
anything still invoked directly:

```jsonc
"permissions": {
  // Only the READ dispatcher is allowlisted. Allowlisting `vetted-op` itself
  // would grant every write in the catalogue, since --caller is argv.
  "allow": [
    "Bash(uv run --project ~/.claude/plugins/cache/apache-magpie/magpie-vetted-ops/*/tools/vetted-ops vetted-op-read *)"
  ],
  "ask": [
    "Bash(uv run --project ~/.claude/plugins/cache/apache-magpie/magpie-vetted-ops/*/tools/vetted-ops vetted-op *)"
  ],
  "deny": [
    "Edit(~/.claude/plugins/cache/apache-magpie/magpie-vetted-ops/**)",
    "Write(~/.claude/plugins/cache/apache-magpie/magpie-vetted-ops/**)",
    "Edit(.apache-magpie-overrides/tools/vetted-ops/**)",
    "Write(.apache-magpie-overrides/tools/vetted-ops/**)"
  ]
}
```

The dispatcher must live where the agent cannot rewrite it — otherwise an agent
that edits `ops.py` has defeated the whole design. That is why it ships as the
`magpie-vetted-ops` **substrate plugin**: the installed plugin tree is not a path
the agent edits, and it sits outside every `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` root,
so sandboxed Bash cannot write there either.

The `deny` rules above are the other half, and the `allow` is not defensible
without them. Two surfaces define what the dispatcher may do — the operation
catalogue and the **policy**, which names the caller→operation grants. An agent
able to edit either one can grant itself the write access the wildcard `ask`
rules were removed for; adding an op to the catalogue and adding itself to a
caller list reach the same place.

Be clear about the asymmetry: the catalogue is protected twice (deny rules plus
the sandbox), the policy only once. The policy lives inside the adopter repo,
which is sandbox-writable by design, so a Bash-level write (`sed -i`, a heredoc)
is **not** covered by an `Edit`/`Write` deny. If that gap matters, keep the
policy outside the writable root and point `--config` at it. Vendoring the
dispatcher itself into a repo the agent edits reduces it to the same single
layer.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --project . python -m pytest
```

The suite asserts the properties above rather than the plumbing: hostile
parameters are refused, every builder produces a `gh` argv, the repo cannot be
influenced by a parameter, body files outside the workspace are rejected while
hostile body *content* passes through untouched, and a caller cannot run an
operation outside its manifest.
