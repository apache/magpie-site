**Capability:** substrate:framework-dev + substrate:analytics

**Harness:** agnostic

Measures full local skill files with pinned `tiktoken` and stamps each count
into that skill's own frontmatter as `measured_tokens:`. The per-skill table in
[mode economics](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/mode-economics.md) is rendered from those stamps by
the website build (or locally with `--table`); it is not committed.
Implements the deterministic measurement check discussed in
[issue 327](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/327).

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ via uv, with pinned `tiktoken`.
- **CLIs:** None beyond uv and Python for file counts. The optional runtime
  replay adapter requires Claude Code.
- **Credentials / auth:** None for file counts. The opt-in replay adapter
  uses the Claude Code authentication and provider network configuration.
- **Network:** Package installation uses the configured package index.
  Only the explicit preparation command downloads the checksum-verified
  vocabulary from `openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net`. Measurements require
  the prepared cache and do not bootstrap it automatically.

## Usage

From the repository root, prepare once in a terminal outside the isolated
agent before running checks. No sandbox allowlist change is needed:

```bash
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count skill-token-count --prepare-tokenizer
```

The default persistent cache is `~/.cache/apache-magpie/tiktoken/`, shared
between worktrees. `TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR` can select a pre-provisioned cache
(including one copied to an offline machine); an empty value is rejected.
The vocabulary SHA-256 is checked before measurement.

Then stamp, check, or print:

```bash
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count skill-token-count --write
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count skill-token-count --check
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count skill-token-count --table
uv run --directory tools/skill-token-count pytest
```

`--check` is the default and never writes. Exit status is 0 when every stamp
is current, 1 for a missing or stale stamp, and 2 for invalid input.
`--write` rewrites only the `measured_tokens:` line of the skills whose count
changed; nothing is staged. `--table` prints the per-skill markdown table to
stdout and writes nothing. `--root PATH` supports a different checkout or an
extracted source archive.

## Measurement and provenance

Each regular `skills/*/SKILL.md` is read as UTF-8, with LF-normalized line
endings, including frontmatter and comments, and **excluding the
`measured_tokens:` line itself** — so writing the stamp never changes the
count it records. `encode_ordinary` counts literal special-token spellings as
text. Referenced documents, tool output, model responses, and external
`source.md` redirects are not included. Harness symlinks outside `skills/`
are not counted again. Symlinked skill files are errors.

The stamp sits immediately **after** `license:`; `surface_hash:` sits
immediately **before** it. Anchoring on opposite sides keeps the two
stampers from reordering each other's line, so each is idempotent whichever
runs last.

### Why a per-skill stamp, not a committed table

The counts used to live in one generated table in `docs/mode-economics.md`,
with a measurement date and a manifest hash that changed on every
regeneration. Every PR that touched any skill rewrote those shared lines,
and alphabetically adjacent rows collided too, so almost any two skill PRs
conflicted. A stamp in the skill's own file changes only when that skill
changes, so two PRs conflict on it only when they edit the same skill —
which they would anyway.

This tool works without Git history, including shallow CI and source
archives. No runtime percentiles or provider billing measurements are
inferred.

## Hook

The prek hook checks after skill fixers and runs on skill, generator, or
lockfile changes. A dedicated path-filtered CI workflow prepares the
vocabulary and checks every stamp. The general CI all-files run excludes this
hook to avoid running token measurements on unrelated PRs. It deliberately
checks rather than mutates; restamp with `--write` and rerun prek after drift.

## Scope

This implements file-count provenance and drift detection from
[issue 327](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/327), not the complete
measurement programme. A [dated replay sample](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/skill-token-count/benchmarks/2026-09-11.md)
and a [patch-drafting sample](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/skill-token-count/benchmarks/2026-09-11-drafting.md) provide
actual CLI-usage percentiles for five skills across four modes. File counts
alone cannot supply those metrics. Production workload
percentiles and cross-model comparisons still require broader observations;
a PR should state this scope rather than claiming universal mode costs.

## Runtime replay benchmark

The optional `skill_token_count.runtime` module measures actual model usage for
synthetic decision-to-draft/report replays. It loads each full skill entrypoint
and sibling Markdown references, then supplies captured project/configuration
and tool observations from `benchmarks/replay-v1.json`. Live tools and MCP
servers are disabled; there are no external writes. It stops at the approval
boundary. This is distinct from both per-step evals and live operational runs.

This adapter requires an authenticated Claude Code CLI. Model calls may incur
charges and run only with explicit `--run`; ordinary tests and CI never launch
the benchmark. Default: three scenarios per skill, two repetitions, four workers. Modes are
validated against skill frontmatter before any call; summaries group by skill
so two Mentoring skills do not silently become one distribution.

```bash
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count python -m skill_token_count.runtime \
  --run --records /tmp/magpie-runtime-records.json
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count python -m skill_token_count.runtime \
  --records /tmp/magpie-runtime-records.json
# Run the three distinct patch-drafting scenarios:
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count python -m skill_token_count.runtime \
  --run --corpus tools/skill-token-count/benchmarks/drafting-v1.json \
  --records /tmp/magpie-drafting-records.json
# Render a saved run without calling a model:
uv run --project tools/skill-token-count python -m skill_token_count.runtime \
  --records tools/skill-token-count/benchmarks/2026-09-11.json --format markdown
```

The collector accepts object or event-array CLI output and requires a single
terminal result with numeric usage. It preserves failures; missing usage is an
error, never zero. p50 and p90 use linear interpolation with inclusive endpoints
(Hyndman-Fan type 7); only successful CLI results enter these distributions.
A successful CLI result is not a quality grade. Inspect the recorded responses
before describing them as completed tasks.

Totals sum `modelUsage` across models: input + cache creation + cache reads +
output. Thinking tokens are already included in output and are not added again.
Top-level `usage` is retained separately because it can omit auxiliary CLI calls.
Cache reads count toward token traffic, not as full-price uncached input.
Any CLI-reported cost is informational list-price telemetry, not a billing record.

Run metadata includes CLI/model versions, source commit and per-file hashes,
corpus and prompt hashes, repetitions, timestamps, durations, usage and final
responses. A fresh working directory prevents repository auto-discovery, but
user/admin CLI settings and provider caching may still affect overhead.
Cross-machine or cross-model equivalence is not assumed. Only synthetic inputs
belong in the published corpus; do not import private project traces here.

The first sample's `drafting-*` identifiers are legacy IDs for
`good-first-issue-author`, a Mentoring skill. Its labels and corpus hash were
corrected; the original hash is retained in `metadata_correction`. Prompts,
responses, usage, and timestamps were not changed. The Drafting sample uses
`issue-fix-workflow` and measures patch generation, not patch application or
red/green test execution. CLI completion is not evidence that tests passed,
even when a generated PR draft says they did.
