Maintainer-facing skills that join contributor threads in a teaching
register, author newcomer-ready issues, curate the existing backlog for
newcomers, orient first-time contributors, explain issue context to
newcomers, and track a contributor's readiness path to committer nomination.
Six skills shipped at `experimental`.

MISSION names Agentic Mentoring as the highest-value project-side mode and the one
off-the-shelf agent tooling skips. The framework lands the spec — tone guide,
hand-off protocol, adopter contract — and the skill implementations together,
so the project's tone choices are reviewable independently of runtime
behaviour and can be evolved without editing the skill body.

> [!TIP]
> **Why this family**
> - First-time contributors get a real welcome that names what their PR changed, not a template
> - An issue explained to a newcomer in a teaching register — what breaks, where, and how to check
> - Good first issues that are actually finishable, and the ones that only need a sentence to become so

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 4 skills. Newcomer-facing mentoring — welcome, explain, and curate first issues.

Once you have [added the marketplace](/docs/setup/marketplace-install):

```text
/plugin install magpie-mentoring@apache-magpie
```

New to Magpie? The [quick start](/docs/quick-start) walks the whole path in
one place — install, the first `/magpie-setup` run, and a recording of it
happening — plus the other agents and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### Before the first run

<!-- BEGIN generated: skill-config (tools/dev/check-skill-config.py --fix) -->

![An animated `/magpie-setup config` run for the mentoring family: the check failing, the values derived from the repository, one question for the rest, and gitignored files written](/docs-assets/quickstart/wizard/mentoring.svg)

*Illustrative — the real run derives more and asks better. What is true is
the shape: it runs itself, it writes only gitignored files, and it stages
nothing.*

Every skill here resolves project-specific values from the adopter's
[`<project-config>/`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/projects/_template/) directory — which is
`.apache-magpie-local/` (gitignored, yours) first, then
`.apache-magpie-overrides/` (committed, the project's).

**For yourself:** `/magpie-setup config` scaffolds and fills these locally.
Nothing is staged, nothing is committed, and it works on a repository that
has never adopted Magpie.

**For the project:** [`/magpie-setup adopt`](/docs/setup/team-adoption)
commits them for every contributor, either scaffolded directly or promoted
from what you configured locally.

**Required.** Without these a skill would act on a guess, so it stops and
says which file is missing.

| File | What it carries | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [`good-first-issue-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/good-first-issue-config.md) | What counts as a good first issue here: labels, size limits, and the areas safe to hand to a newcomer. | `good-first-issue-author`, `good-first-issue-sweep` |
| [`issue-tracker-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/issue-tracker-config.md) | Tracker URL, project key, auth model, default query templates. | `good-first-issue-author`, `good-first-issue-sweep` |
| [`project.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/project.md) | Project manifest. Identity, repositories, mailing lists, tools enabled, CVE tooling, GitHub project-board + issue-template field declarations. The single file every skill reads to resolve project-scoped references. | `good-first-issue-author`, `good-first-issue-sweep`, `newcomer-issue-explainer`, `welcome` |

**Optional.** Each has a documented fallback; absent, the skill still runs.

| File | What it carries | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [`mentoring-welcome-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/mentoring-welcome-config.md) | Wording and triggers for first-time-contributor welcomes. | `welcome` |
| [`newcomer-issue-explainer-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/newcomer-issue-explainer-config.md) | How much context an explanation carries, and the register it is written in. | `newcomer-issue-explainer` |

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Welcome a first-time contributor.**

```text
/magpie-mentoring:welcome
```

![A welcome run drafting a distinct greeting for each of three first-time contributors, naming what each PR actually changed](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/mentoring/welcome.svg)

**Curate the good-first-issue backlog.**

```text
/magpie-mentoring:good-first-issue-sweep
```

![A good-first-issue-sweep run: two issues ready for a newcomer, two that are close but missing context or need a design decision](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/mentoring/good-first-issue-sweep.svg)

**Explain an issue to a newcomer.**

```text
/magpie-mentoring:newcomer-issue-explainer
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`pr-management-mentor`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/pr-management-mentor/SKILL.md) | Draft a teaching-register comment on a single GitHub issue or PR thread; waits for maintainer confirmation before posting. | experimental |
| [`good-first-issue-author`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/good-first-issue-author/SKILL.md) | Draft one net-new good first issue from a supplied gap or small task; a suitability gate and R1–R9 readiness checklist gate the draft; waits for maintainer confirmation before filing via `gh`. | experimental |
| [`mentoring-welcome`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/mentoring-welcome/SKILL.md) | Draft a first-contact orientation comment for a first-time contributor on a newly opened issue or PR; detects first-time authorship via the GitHub `author_association` field; skips repeat contributors. | experimental |
| [`newcomer-issue-explainer`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/newcomer-issue-explainer/SKILL.md) | Explain a single issue's context, relevant code paths, and expected approach to a newcomer who has claimed it; teaching register, never gatekeeps. | experimental |
| [`good-first-issue-sweep`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/good-first-issue-sweep/SKILL.md) | Sweep the open issue backlog for existing issues that could be labelled as good first issues; scores each against the G1–G7 suitability rubric and classifies as READY / NEAR-MISS / SKIP; proposes labels only after explicit maintainer confirmation. | experimental |
| [`contributor-to-committer`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/contributor-to-committer/SKILL.md) | Read-only readiness tracker that maps a contributor's GitHub activity against the adopter's declared committer/PMC thresholds; surfaces a traffic-light brief (Not yet / Approaching / Ready to nominate) plus the specific evidence gaps that remain. (`family: contributor-growth` — cross-listed here for the mentoring path continuity.) | experimental |

All six skills are read-only on tracker state or draft-then-confirm: no
skill posts, labels, closes, or files anything without explicit maintainer
confirmation in-session.

### What each skill covers

- **`pr-management-mentor`** — the thread-level Agentic Mentoring skill. Reads an
  issue or PR thread, decides whether a teaching-register intervention is
  warranted (clarifying question, convention pointer, paired example from a
  prior PR), drafts the comment, and waits for maintainer confirmation before
  posting. Never reviews code, routes PRs, or authors fixes — those are Agentic Triage
  and Agentic Drafting respectively.
- **`good-first-issue-author`** — the issue on-ramp skill. Takes a maintainer-
  supplied gap or small task, applies a suitability gate (too large, security-
  sensitive, or requiring a design decision → decline), runs through R1–R9
  readiness criteria, and drafts one self-contained issue a newcomer can pick
  up without prior repo context: scope, code pointers, contributing-doc links,
  acceptance criteria, and a rough effort estimate.
- **`mentoring-welcome`** — the first-contact skill. Triggered immediately
  after a first-time contributor opens an issue or PR.
  Drafts a lightweight orientation comment (contributing-guide link,
  community-norm pointers, expected next steps). Skips silently for repeat
  contributors and security-sensitive threads.
- **`newcomer-issue-explainer`** — the issue-context skill. When a newcomer
  claims a good-first-issue, explains the relevant code paths, project context,
  and expected approach in a teaching register.
- **`contributor-to-committer`** — the readiness-tracking skill. Takes a
  GitHub handle, fetches their public activity on `<upstream>`, and maps it
  against the adopter's declared committer or PMC thresholds from
  `committer-readiness.md`. Returns a traffic-light verdict (Not yet /
  Approaching / Ready to nominate) plus a gap table showing exactly what
  evidence the contributor still needs. Read-only; never opens a nomination
  thread, sends a message, or modifies any record.
- **`good-first-issue-sweep`** — the backlog-curation skill. Sweeps the
  open issue backlog and scores each issue against the G1–G7 suitability
  rubric (scope, self-containment, code pointer, small effort, no security
  sensitivity, no architectural decision, no deprecation decision).
  Classifies each as READY (propose the GFI label), NEAR-MISS (surface
  specific edits that would make it GFI-ready), or SKIP (not suitable).
  Complements `good-first-issue-author`: the sweep stocks the on-ramp queue
  from existing work; the author creates net-new issues from supplied gaps.
  Read-only; proposes labels only after explicit maintainer confirmation.

## Adopter contract

The generated table under
[*Before the first run*](#before-the-first-run) lists every file these skills
read. The [spec's adopter-contract section](/docs/mentoring/spec#adopter-contract) documents
the keys inside each one.

## Status

**Experimental.** Six skills shipped. No adopter has run the full
contributor-to-committer interaction path under evaluation conditions yet;
shape may change between framework versions.

To provide pilot feedback, copy
[`docs/pilot-report-template.md`](/docs/pilot-report-template) into your
project notes, fill in each section, and optionally validate the filled-in
report with:

```bash
uv run --project tools/pilot-report-validator pilot-report-validate <your-report.md>
```
