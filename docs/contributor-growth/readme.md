> **Scope — `organization: ASF` · 🪶 ASF-specific.** This family encodes Apache Software
> Foundation processes (the contributor-to-committer path) and assumes an ASF
> adopter profile by default. Non-ASF projects can still adopt it through the
> adapter/config layer, but it carries ASF assumptions the generic families do not.

Maintainer-facing skills that span the contributor-to-committer path:
welcoming first-time contributors, keeping the issue backlog newcomer-
ready, tracking contribution activity, checking readiness against declared
thresholds, measuring contributor sentiment, assembling nomination evidence,
and walking nominators through post-vote onboarding. Nine skills cover the staged path from first contact
through committer promotion.

Why a framework skill family? The contributor-to-committer path is one
of the highest-leverage levers an open-source project has for long-term
health — lowering onboarding friction and shortening the time from first
PR to committer status keeps the contributor pipeline healthy. These
skills were designed independently but cover a contiguous path; grouping
them makes the adopter configuration and the evaluation story coherent.

> [!TIP]
> **Why this family**
> - A nomination brief built from a year of evidence rather than a recent impression
> - The post-vote checklist, from ICLA to welcome mail, with the steps that need a PMC chair marked
> - It names what GitHub cannot see — mailing lists, release votes, mentoring — instead of quietly scoring without them

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 9 skills. The path-to-committer track.

Once you have [added the marketplace](/docs/setup/marketplace-install):

```text
/plugin install magpie-contributor-growth@apache-magpie
```

New to Magpie? The [quick start](/docs/quick-start) walks the whole path in
one place — install, the first `/magpie-setup` run, and a recording of it
happening — plus the other agents and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### Before the first run

<!-- BEGIN generated: skill-config (tools/dev/check-skill-config.py --fix) -->

![An animated `/magpie-setup config` run for the contributor-growth family: the check failing, the values derived from the repository, one question for the rest, and gitignored files written](/docs-assets/quickstart/wizard/contributor-growth.svg)

*Illustrative — the real run derives more and asks better. What is true is
the shape: it runs itself, it writes only gitignored files, and it stages
nothing.*

Every skill here resolves project-specific values from the adopter's
[`<project-config>/`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/plugins/magpie-setup/templates) directory — which is
`.apache-magpie-local/` (gitignored, yours) first, then
`.apache-magpie-overrides/` (committed, the project's).

**For yourself:** `/magpie-setup config` scaffolds and fills these locally.
Nothing is staged, nothing is committed, and it works on a repository that
has never adopted Magpie.

**For the project:** [`/magpie-setup adopt`](/docs/setup/team-adoption)
commits them for every contributor, either scaffolded directly or promoted
from what you configured locally.

**Required.** Without these a skill would act on a guess, so it stops and
says which file is missing.

| File | What it carries | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [`committer-onboarding-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/templates/committer-onboarding-config.md) | Capability-flag vocabulary for committer intake and governance models (`icla`/`dco`/`no-cla`; `asf-pmc`/`github-codeowners`/`maintainer-roster`). | `committer-onboarding` |

|---|---|---|
| [`contributor-identities.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/templates/contributor-identities.md) | The project's community channels, and confirmed mappings from each contributor's GitHub handle to their Slack, Discord, mailing-list, and social-media handles. Written by `contributor-identity-map` after a maintainer confirms each one. | `committer-onboarding`, `identity-map` |
| [`pmc-roster.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/templates/pmc-roster.md) | Who is binding. Read wherever a vote is counted or a PMC-only action is gated. | `candidate-screen`, `nomination` |

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Sweep recent contributor activity.**

**Draft a nomination brief.**

```text
/magpie-contributor-growth:nomination
```

## Stage coverage

| Stage | Skill | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **First contact** | [`mentoring-welcome`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-mentoring/skills/welcome/SKILL.md) | Drafts an orientation comment for a first-time contributor on a newly opened issue or PR; detects first-time authorship via the GitHub `author_association` field and skips repeat contributors. |
| **Issue on-ramp** | [`good-first-issue-author`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-mentoring/skills/good-first-issue-author/SKILL.md) | Drafts one net-new good first issue from a supplied gap or small task; a suitability gate and R1–R9 readiness checklist gate the draft; waits for maintainer confirmation before filing via `gh`. |
| **Backlog curation** | [`good-first-issue-sweep`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-mentoring/skills/good-first-issue-sweep/SKILL.md) | Sweeps the open issue backlog for existing issues that could be labelled as good first issues; scores each against the G1–G7 suitability rubric; classifies as READY / NEAR-MISS / SKIP and proposes labels after explicit maintainer confirmation. |
| **Activity tracking** | [`contributor-activity-sweep`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/activity-sweep/SKILL.md) | Produces a read-only GitHub activity card (PRs authored, code reviews, issues, comments) over a configurable window. |
| **Calibration** | [`contributor-calibrate`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/calibrate/SKILL.md) | Derives committer and PMC threshold floors from the project's own past nomination decisions on the private list; proposes a config diff holding numbers only, with nothing about any nominee leaving the session. |
| **Candidate screening** | [`contributor-candidate-screen`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/candidate-screen/SKILL.md) | Screens every recent contributor against the calibrated floors, shortlists committer and PMC candidates, and writes a per-candidate evidence report — areas, floors, community signals, two or three paragraphs each — to a repository the GitHub API reports as private, after the maintainer has read it. |
| **Readiness check** | [`contributor-to-committer`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/contributor-to-committer/SKILL.md) | Maps a contributor's GitHub activity against the adopter's PMC-declared committer or PMC thresholds; surfaces a traffic-light brief (Not yet / Approaching / Ready to nominate) and a gap table showing what would close each remaining gap. Read-only; never opens a nomination thread. |
| **Identity mapping** | [`contributor-identity-map`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/identity-map/SKILL.md) | Maps any contributor's GitHub handle to their Slack, Discord, Matrix, mailing-list, and social-media handles; infers from the sources the session can reach and records only the mappings a maintainer confirms. Used by `committer-onboarding` and `contributor-nomination`. |
| **Nomination brief** | [`contributor-nomination`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/nomination/SKILL.md) | Assembles evidence prose for a committer or PMC vote thread: activity breadth, consistency, vendor-neutrality context, and a nomination-ready summary. Read-only; never posts to any list. |
| **Sentiment analysis** | [`contributor-sentiment`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/sentiment/SKILL.md) | Analyse contributor sentiment signals (issue tone, PR abandonment, response-time frustration) to surface early-warning indicators of contributor disengagement. Read-only. |
| **Onboarding concierge** | [`onboarding-concierge`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/onboarding-concierge/SKILL.md) | Interactive first-session guide for new contributors: walks through repo setup, points to good first issues, introduces project conventions and communication channels. |
| **Post-vote onboarding** | [`committer-onboarding`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-contributor-growth/skills/committer-onboarding/SKILL.md) | Walks the nominator through ICLA check, account provisioning, permissions grant, and the welcome announcement for committer and PMC promotions at ASF TLPs and podlings. |

Every stage is read-only on governance artefacts or propose-before-post:
no skill modifies a roster, posts an announcement, or files an issue
without explicit maintainer confirmation.

All twelve skills are `experimental`; no adopter has run the full
contributor-to-committer path under evaluation conditions yet.

## Family boundary

This family sits **alongside** two overlapping skill families:

- [`docs/mentoring/README.md`](/docs/mentoring/readme) — the Agentic Mentoring
  mode spec and family overview. `mentoring-welcome`,
  `good-first-issue-author`, and `good-first-issue-sweep` carry
  `mode: Mentoring` and are also listed in that spec. The families
  cross-reference each other; a later maturity review may clarify the
  boundary or merge the two into one.
- [`docs/issue-management/README.md`](/docs/issue-management/readme) —
  general-issue triage and fix workflow. The contributor-growth family
  reads GitHub activity data about contributors, not issue content; the
  two families use different query surfaces and produce different
  artefacts (activity cards and nomination briefs vs. issue disposition
  proposals).

Skills in this family propose every state-changing action for human
sign-off. `committer-onboarding` emits paste-ready command recipes the
nominator executes as themselves; no skill submits an ICLA form, invites
an account, or modifies repository permissions without the nominator's
direct action.

## Status

**Experimental.** All eleven skills are on main with eval suites; no
adopter has run the full contributor-to-committer path end-to-end under
evaluation conditions.

Known deferred items (each pending a spec-RFC pass that enumerates
per-project policy knobs before a skill can safely propose anything):

- **PMC-member nomination** — vote mechanics, quorum rules, and
  post-vote steps differ from committer promotion and warrant a
  separate capability-flag variant of `committer-onboarding` or a
  standalone skill.
- **Emeritus / inactive-committer handling and contributor offboarding**
  — these involve project-level governance decisions (roster policy,
  access removal, farewell communication norms) that need per-project
  configuration.
