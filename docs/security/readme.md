> **Scope.** Works on any project, ASF or not. The ASF intake
> path (`security@`, Vulnogram CVE flow) is the default profile; non-ASF
> adopters swap it for GitHub Security Advisories / a MITRE CNA through the
> adapter/config layer.

End-to-end automation for an ASF project's security-issue handling
process — from inbound report on the project's `security@` mailing
list through to a published CVE record on `cve.org`. Eleven skills
that compose into the canonical 16-step lifecycle, three that produce,
verify, and maintain the project's own security model, plus one
read-only supporting skill for tracker-stats dashboards (fifteen skills
total).

Why a framework skill family? The 16-step process exists across
the foundation; every project's security team runs essentially
the same workflow with project-specific scope labels, mailing-list
addresses, milestone formats, and canned-response wording. Lifting
the workflow into a project-agnostic framework lets each adopter
plug their specifics into [`<project-config>/`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/projects/_template/)
and reuse the skills verbatim.

> [!TIP]
> **Why this family**
> - Every report that lands on security@ becomes a tracked issue, with a receipt drafted to the reporter
> - The whole lifecycle in one place — triage, CVE allocation, the fix PR that does not leak the embargo, and the advisory
> - Read-only until you confirm: no label flips, no closes, and no CVE allocated without you saying so

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 15 skills. The security-report lifecycle, from intake through CVE publication.

Once you have [added the marketplace](/docs/setup/marketplace-install):

```text
/plugin install magpie-security@apache-magpie
```

New to Magpie? The [quick start](/docs/quick-start) walks the whole path in
one place — install, the first `/magpie-setup` run, and a recording of it
happening — plus the other agents and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### Before the first run

<!-- BEGIN generated: skill-config (tools/dev/check-skill-config.py --fix) -->

![An animated `/magpie-setup config` run for the security family: the check failing, the values derived from the repository, one question for the rest, and gitignored files written](/docs-assets/quickstart/wizard/security.svg)

*Illustrative — the real run derives more and asks better. What is true is
the shape: it runs itself, it writes only gitignored files, and it stages
nothing.*

Every skill here resolves project-specific values from the adopter's
[`<project-config>/`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/projects/_template/) directory — which is
`.apache-magpie-local/` (gitignored, yours) first, then
`.apache-magpie-overrides/` (committed, the project's).

**For yourself:** `/magpie-setup config` scaffolds and fills these locally.
Nothing is staged, nothing is committed, and it works on a repository that
has never adopted Magpie.

**For the project:** [`/magpie-setup adopt`](/docs/setup/team-adoption)
commits them for every contributor, either scaffolded directly or promoted
from what you configured locally.

**Required.** Without these a skill would act on a guess, so it stops and
says which file is missing.

| File | What it carries | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [`fix-workflow.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/fix-workflow.md) | Fork / clone / toolchain specifics, backport-label policy, commit-trailer wording, PR scrubbing, private-PR fallback. | `issue-fix` |

| [`project.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/project.md) | Project manifest. Identity, repositories, mailing lists, tools enabled, CVE tooling, GitHub project-board + issue-template field declarations. The single file every skill reads to resolve project-scoped references. | `cve-allocate`, `issue-deduplicate`, `issue-fix`, `issue-import`, `issue-import-from-pr`, `issue-import-from-scan`, `issue-import-via-forwarder`, `issue-invalidate`, `issue-triage`, `model-verify`, `tracker-stats-dashboard` |
| [`scanner-products.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/scanner-products.md) | Private scanner product names, and the finder-anonymisation rule applied before anything is quoted publicly. | `issue-sync` |
| [`scope-labels.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/scope-labels.md) | Scope label → CVE product / `packageName` / collection-URL mapping. Exactly one scope label per tracker. | `issue-deduplicate`, `issue-import-from-md`, `issue-import-from-pr`, `issue-triage`, `tracker-stats-dashboard` |
| [`security-intake-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/security-intake-config.md) | Capability-flag vocabulary for the intake path: how reports arrive, what counts as in scope, and what a receipt says. | `issue-import` |
| [`security-model.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/security-model.md) | Authoritative URL for the project's Security Model + known-useful anchors + drafting rule. | `issue-triage`, `model-prepare`, `model-verify` |
| [`security-tracker-stats.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/security-tracker-stats.md) | Which tracker fields and windows the stats dashboard reads, and what it publishes. | `tracker-stats-dashboard` |
| [`title-normalization.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/title-normalization.md) | Regex cascade the `security-cve-allocate` skill applies to tracker titles before pasting them into the CVE-tool allocation form. | `cve-allocate` |

**Optional.** Each has a documented fallback; absent, the skill still runs.

| File | What it carries | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [`canned-responses.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/canned-responses.md) | Reusable reporter-facing reply templates. | `issue-import`, `issue-import-from-scan`, `issue-invalidate`, `issue-sync`, `issue-triage`, `model-update` |
| [`distributor-list.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/distributor-list.md) | The embargo distributor list a pre-announcement goes to, and what it may contain. Absent, no pre-announcement is proposed. | `issue-sync` |
| [`privacy-llm.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/privacy-llm.md) | Which model tier may see which class of content, for projects routing foundation-private information away from third-party models. | `issue-import` |

### Works well with

Third-party packages, none of them required: this family works with none of
them installed, and Magpie neither bundles nor depends on any. They are named
because they are what a maintainer goes looking for next, and because the
answer differs by agent.

**[Aikido Security](https://www.aikido.dev/)** — Aikido

SAST, secrets and infrastructure-as-code scanning surfaced in the session.

*With this family:* A second opinion from a conventional scanner, and a different class of finding — committed secrets — from the ones a code-reading scan surfaces.

Available on **Claude Code** only.

**[Claude Security](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-security)** — Anthropic

A multi-agent vulnerability scan of your own repository, run inside the session; each finding carries a severity, a CWE category and reproduction steps, and the ones you pick become patch files you review before applying.

*With this family:* This family handles reports that arrive — intake, triage, CVE, advisory. Scanning finds the ones nobody reported. The two meet at security-issue-import-from-scan, which imports scanner output as trackers.

Available on **Claude Code** only.

Claude Code only: it drives subagents and a scan workflow that Agent Plugins 1.0 has no component for. Listed with its harness named rather than presented as the answer for everyone.

Install commands per agent are in
[**Companion skill packages**](/docs/setup/companion-skills).

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Pull new reports out of the mailbox.**

```text
/magpie-security:issue-import
```

![An issue-import run: two security@ threads with no tracker yet, each becoming a Needs-triage issue with a receipt drafted to the reporter, pending confirmation](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/security/issue-import.svg)

**Triage what came in.**

```text
/magpie-security:issue-triage
```

![An issue-triage run classifying four trackers as valid, defence-in-depth, info-only and a probable duplicate, with every disposition still a proposal](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/security/issue-triage.svg)

**Check the security model still matches reality.**

```text
/magpie-security:model-verify
```

![A model-verify run: two green checks that the threat model and the code agree, and one failure where the model still names a surface no route serves](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/security/model-verify.svg)

### Security-model skills

The lifecycle skills above route **one report**. These three maintain the
document they route it against — the project's security model — so that
routing has something to cite. See
[**`security-model-preparation.md`**](/docs/security/security-model-preparation) for
the lifecycle and the rationale.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`security-model-prepare`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/security-model-prepare/SKILL.md) | Produce a first model for a project that has none, in draft-first mode, and land it with its discoverability chain as one PR per repository. |
| [`security-model-verify`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/security-model-verify/SKILL.md) | Pre-flight an existing model: can an agent mechanically reach it, and does it cover the minimum bar a triager depends on. Discoverability is the only hard gate. |
| [`security-model-update`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/security-model-update/SKILL.md) | Read the decision history back into the model — new known-non-finding entries and a model-gap list, regression-checked against past valid reports. |

The rubric these skills measure against is maintained externally by
Alpha-Omega (<https://github.com/alpha-omega-security/threat-model>) and
referenced by URL; Magpie keeps no local copy.

### Supporting tools

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`security-tracker-stats-dashboard`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/SKILL.md) | Generate a self-contained HTML dashboard of `<tracker>` repo statistics (lifecycle bands, opened-vs-untriaged backlog, mean time to triage / first response / fix). Read-only — never modifies tracker state. |

## Deep documentation

- [**`poc-handling-policy.md`**](/docs/security/poc-handling-policy) — what an
  agent may do with reporter-supplied proof-of-concept code: static
  review by default, isolated container only on explicit approval,
  never on the host.
- [**`security-model-preparation.md`**](/docs/security/security-model-preparation) —
  the produce / verify / update lifecycle for the project's own
  security model: the external Alpha-Omega rubric, the
  `AGENTS.md` → `SECURITY.md` discoverability chain and why it is the
  only hard gate, why substantive findings go to the private list
  rather than a public issue, the provenance tags that make a
  draft-first model safe, and the fence around the known-non-findings
  section.
- [**`process.md`**](/docs/security/process) — the 16-step lifecycle with
  Mermaid diagram + per-step description; the label lifecycle
  state diagram + label reference table. The authoritative
  process reference.
- [**`roles.md`**](/docs/security/roles) — who owns which steps (issue
  triager / remediation developer / release manager), the shared
  conventions every role observes (keeping the reporter informed,
  recording status transitions, confidentiality), and the
  role-by-role workflow walkthroughs.
- [**`fixing-security-issues.md`**](/docs/security/fixing-security-issues) —
  hands-on guide for a remediation developer picking up a
  CVE-allocated tracker and shipping the fix.
- [**`how-the-security-team-works.md`**](/docs/security/how-the-security-team-works) —
  how the team operates and how a new member lands: the triager
  rotation that runs the skills and delegates, tracker access, mail
  list subscription, expected reading, first triage shadow.
- [**`threat-model.md`**](/docs/security/threat-model) — release-blocking
  threat model for the security skill family: trust boundaries,
  adversary personas, STRIDE matrix per skill, mitigation cross-
  reference, residual risk, and the re-audit cadence.
- [**`forwarder-routing-policy.md`**](/docs/security/forwarder-routing-policy) —
  when a tracker has no direct reporter contact (ASF-relay,
  read-only GHSA, anonymous tip), the skills route reporter-facing
  communication through the forwarder. The policy defines when
  that mode applies, the milestone list (events that **do** get
  relayed), and the negative list (events that don't — including
  credit-confirmation questions and regular workflow status).
