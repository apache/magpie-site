> [`marketplaces.md`](/docs/setup/marketplaces). The **pinned snapshot install**,

> `uninstall` / `unadopt` reverse it.)

The **setup** skill family is the prerequisite for running any
framework skill. It walks a new adopter (or a fresh dev machine on
an existing adopter) through the secure-agent install — pinned
system tools, the project-scope `.claude/settings.json` sandbox
block, the `claude-iso` clean-env wrapper, the user-scope hooks —
and through the ongoing housekeeping (verify install drift, pull
framework updates, sync shared user-scope config across machines).

Why a dedicated install skill family? The framework's other skills
run against pre-disclosure CVE content, private mailing lists, and
in-flight tracker discussions. Without the layered defence the
setup skills install (sandbox + permission rules + clean-env
wrapper), a misconfigured agent can leak credentials or
pre-disclosure content into the model provider's training data or
into a public PR. The setup family is what makes the rest of the
framework safe to use.

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 9 skills. Sandbox, clean environment, and the framework's own install/upgrade.

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie
```

<!-- CAPTURE: assets/quickstart/README.md -->

New to Magpie? The [quick start](/docs/quick-start) covers the other agents,
the all-in-one alternative, and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Put the agent in its sandbox.**

```text
> /magpie-setup:isolated-setup-install

Proposed changes (nothing applied yet):
  1. .claude/settings.json   sandbox.enabled: true, 14 deny rules
  2. ~/.claude/scripts/      3 hooks + status line
  3. ~/.zshrc                source agent-iso.sh
Apply 1-3? [y/N]
```

**Check it landed.**

```text
> /magpie-setup:isolated-setup-verify

  OK   sandbox.enabled           true
  OK   permissions.deny          14 rules
  WARN pinned tools              bubblewrap 0.11.1 (want 0.11.2)
  OK   status line               wired
```

**See what is wired up.**

```text
> /magpie-setup:status

  install method   marketplace (magpie-setup, magpie-pr-management)
  agent targets    .agents/skills, .claude/skills
  drift            none
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`setup-isolated-setup-install`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md) | First-time install of the secure agent setup. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-verify`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-isolated-setup-verify/SKILL.md) | Verify the secure setup landed correctly (static checks on settings.json, hooks, pinned versions). |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-doctor`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-isolated-setup-doctor/SKILL.md) | Diagnose in-session sandbox friction (SSH agent, port bind, docker/podman socket) and map each fail to a catalog entry. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-update`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-isolated-setup-update/SKILL.md) | Surface drift between the installed setup and the framework's latest. |
| [`setup`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup/SKILL.md) | Adopt and maintain the framework in a project repo through installation, verification, updates, overrides, and unadoption. |
| [`setup upgrade`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup/upgrade.md) | Pull the framework checkout to latest `origin/main`. |
| [`setup verify`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup/verify.md) | Verify the framework is integrated correctly into an adopter tracker. |
| [`setup-status`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-status/SKILL.md) | Render a Markdown adoption dashboard (install pin, drift, wired agent targets, installed skill families, symlink health) and adjust the wiring in place. |
| [`setup-shared-config-sync`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-shared-config-sync/SKILL.md) | Commit + push the user's shared Claude config to its sync repo. |
| [`setup-override-upstream`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-override-upstream/SKILL.md) | Promote a local `.apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md` file into a PR against `apache/magpie`; prompts to remove the override once merged and upgraded. |
| [`setup-upstream-fix`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup-upstream-fix/SKILL.md) | Turn a framework bug or quirk hit mid-session into a fix PR against `apache/magpie`, after checking for an existing issue or PR that already covers it. |

## Deep documentation

- [**`secure-agent-setup.md`**](/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup) — full
  install walkthrough. The authoritative reference the
  `setup-isolated-setup-install` skill steps through.
- [**`secure-agent-internals.md`**](/docs/setup/secure-agent-internals) —
  how the layered defence works (sandbox + permission rules +
  clean-env wrapper) and why each layer exists.
- [**`install-recipes.md`**](/docs/setup/install-recipes) — copy-pasteable
  shell recipes (svn-zip / git-tag / git-branch) for bootstrapping
  `setup` into a new adopter repo.
- [**`uninstall.md`**](/docs/setup/uninstall) — counterpart to `install-recipes.md`:
  remove the framework artefacts the install flow installed. One
  path, full plan surfaced before any write.
- [**`sandbox-troubleshooting.md`**](/docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting) —
  catalog of known sandbox-shaped failure modes (SSH agent /
  Yubikey unreachable, test port-bind blocked, docker/podman
  socket denied) with symptom → root cause → settings.json fix
  for each. The page to grep when a normal-looking operation
  fails in the sandbox in an unexpected way.
- [**`personal-use-unadopted-repo.md`**](/docs/setup/personal-use-unadopted-repo) —
  recipe for using Magpie against a repo that has not adopted the
  framework: whole-user skill install, one `.gitignore` line,
  `.apache-magpie-local/` personal config, then run skills as if
  adopted. No changes to the target repo's committed files (beyond the
  optional `.gitignore` line) and no opt-in from teammates required.
- [**`per-role-mcp-access.md`**](/docs/setup/per-role-mcp-access) — how to
  enable an MCP server for yourself only (e.g. a release manager
  enabling a Policy MCP, a security triage member enabling a
  private CVE database) without touching shared project config:
  register the server in user-scope Claude settings, then write a
  personal `.apache-magpie-local/<skill>.md` override.

## Typical lifecycle

```text
new dev machine
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-install
isolated setup installed
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-verify (any time, especially after Claude Code upgrade)
verified
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-update (monthly / after Claude Code upgrade)
drift surfaced
  ↓ setup-upgrade (when framework releases something new)
framework checkout up to date
```

`setup-shared-config-sync` is orthogonal — it commits the user's
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and other shared config to a private sync
repo so a fresh dev machine can pick it up (run after editing any
file under `~/.claude-config/`).
