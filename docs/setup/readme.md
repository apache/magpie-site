The **setup** skill family is the prerequisite for running any
framework skill. It walks a new adopter (or a fresh dev machine on
an existing adopter) through the secure-agent install — pinned
system tools, the project-scope `.claude/settings.json` sandbox
block, the `claude-iso` clean-env wrapper, the user-scope hooks —
and through the ongoing housekeeping (verify install drift, pull
framework updates, sync shared user-scope config across machines).

Why a dedicated install skill family? The framework's other skills
run against pre-disclosure CVE content, private mailing lists, and
in-flight tracker discussions. Without the layered defence the
setup skills install (sandbox + permission rules + clean-env
wrapper), a misconfigured agent can leak credentials or
pre-disclosure content into the model provider's training data or
into a public PR. The setup family is what makes the rest of the
framework safe to use.

> [!TIP]
> **Why this family**
> - Install, upgrade and adopt the framework without hand-editing a settings file
> - A sandboxed agent with a clean environment, walked through step by step — nothing runs with sudo behind your back
> - One command tells you what is installed, what the project expects, and whether the two agree

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 10 skills. Sandbox, clean environment, and the framework's own install/upgrade.

Once you have [added the marketplace](/docs/setup/marketplace-install):

```text
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie
```

New to Magpie? The [quick start](/docs/quick-start) walks the whole path in
one place — install, the first `/magpie-setup` run, and a recording of it
happening — plus the other agents and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### The first run

This family is what the other nine defer to. `/magpie-setup` works out how
Magpie should be wired into the checkout in front of it, prints the plan, and
waits — the same run the quick start opens with:

![A `/magpie-setup` run in Claude Code: the picker with the baseline three already ticked, the plugins installed for the user, then the secure-agent setup proposing its changes and waiting for approval before writing anything](/docs-assets/quickstart/magpie-setup.svg)

Nothing is written before you approve it.

### Before the first run

<!-- BEGIN generated: skill-config (tools/dev/check-skill-config.py --fix) -->

**Nothing here has to be configured.** These skills read the file below
when it exists — yours in `.apache-magpie-local/` or the project's in
`.apache-magpie-overrides/` — and fall back to a documented default when
it does not.

**Optional.** Each has a documented fallback; absent, the skill still runs.

| File | What it carries | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [`magpie-setup.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/magpie-setup.md) | Overrides for the setup family's own checks. Every key has a default. | `setup` |
| [`privacy-llm.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/privacy-llm.md) | Which model tier may see which class of content, for projects routing foundation-private information away from third-party models. | `privacy-llm` |
| [`project.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/project.md) | Project manifest. Identity, repositories, mailing lists, tools enabled, CVE tooling, GitHub project-board + issue-template field declarations. The single file every skill reads to resolve project-scoped references. | `isolated-setup-install`, `setup` |
| [`skill-sources.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/_template/skill-sources.md) | The install gate for pulling skills/families from trusted external repos. Lists the source ids this project trusts and commits each pin. `/magpie-setup` fetches only what is listed here. Leave empty to run only in-tree framework skills. See [`docs/skill-sources/`](/docs/skill-sources/readme). | `setup` |

<!-- END generated: skill-config -->

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Put the agent in its sandbox.**

```text
/magpie-setup:isolated-setup-install
```

![An isolated-setup-install run listing three proposed changes — settings.json, the user scripts directory, and the shell rc — and waiting for confirmation before any of them](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/setup/isolated-setup-install.svg)

**Check it landed.**

```text
/magpie-setup:isolated-setup-verify
```

![An isolated-setup-verify run: four green checks across the settings wiring and pinned tools, and one warning that the docker socket is not exposed inside the sandbox](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/setup/isolated-setup-verify.svg)

**See what is wired up.**

```text
/magpie-setup:status
```

![A status run: the install method, the installed plugins, the project's committed floor, and two green checks saying this machine is at or above it](/docs-assets/quickstart/families/setup/status.svg)

## Security mailing-list configuration

Set `security_list` in your project manifest to your project's private
security mailing list. If it is missing, blank, or still a template TODO,
security workflows warn and resolve draft CC from
`security_inbox.foundation_security_address` through the normal
project/organization/default configuration chain. For ASF adopters the
organization supplies `security@apache.org`; other adopters use their own
organization's configured address. If neither address is configured,
drafting is blocked until configuration is corrected.

The selected address and fallback are shown before draft confirmation.
This does not configure subscriptions or redirect list searches to the
organization's mailbox. Configure mail reads separately; read-only work
can continue only when its own prerequisites are met. See the shared
[security draft CC resolution](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/mail-source/contract.md#security-draft-cc-resolution)
for the complete rule.

## Deep documentation

- [**The Apache Magpie Marketplace**](/docs/setup/marketplace) — the one marketplace
  the project publishes, and the recommended way to install. Every agent that
  can add it, which families to pick, pinning, updates, and verification
  status.
- [**Your first run with a family**](/docs/quick-start/first-run) — the
  configuration walkthrough in terminal steps: what stops, what the wizard
  scaffolds, and which files a family needs before it will run.
- [**Companion skill packages**](/docs/setup/companion-skills) — third-party skill
  packages that pair with a Magpie family, and the install command for each
  agent that has one. None is a dependency.
- [**`secure-agent-setup.md`**](/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup) — full
  install walkthrough. The authoritative reference the
  `setup-isolated-setup-install` skill steps through.
- [**`secure-agent-internals.md`**](/docs/setup/secure-agent-internals) —
  how the layered defence works (sandbox + permission rules +
  clean-env wrapper) and why each layer exists.
- [**`install-recipes.md`**](/docs/quick-start/other-install-methods) — copy-pasteable
  shell recipes (svn-zip / git-tag / git-branch) for bootstrapping
  `setup` into a new adopter repo.
- [**`uninstall.md`**](/docs/setup/uninstall) — counterpart to `install-recipes.md`:
  remove the framework artefacts the install flow installed. One
  path, full plan surfaced before any write.
- [**`sandbox-troubleshooting.md`**](/docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting) —
  catalog of known sandbox-shaped failure modes (SSH agent /
  Yubikey unreachable, test port-bind blocked, docker/podman
  socket denied) with symptom → root cause → settings.json fix
  for each. The page to grep when a normal-looking operation
  fails in the sandbox in an unexpected way.
- [**Individual use**](/docs/setup/individual-use) — using Magpie on any repo, adopted
  or not, with nothing committed and nothing asked of teammates. The default,
  and the half that asks no one's permission.
- [**Team adoption**](/docs/setup/team-adoption) — what a repo commits so every
  contributor arrives with a recommended set: the floor lock, the default
  plugin set, the shared overrides, and keeping them current. The maintainer
  half of the pair.
- [**`per-role-mcp-access.md`**](/docs/setup/per-role-mcp-access) — how to
  enable an MCP server for yourself only (e.g. a release manager
  enabling a Policy MCP, a security triage member enabling a
  private CVE database) without touching shared project config:
  register the server in user-scope Claude settings, then write a
  personal `.apache-magpie-local/<skill>.md` override.

## Typical lifecycle

```text
new dev machine
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-install
isolated setup installed
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-verify (any time, especially after Claude Code upgrade)
verified
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-update (monthly / after Claude Code upgrade)
drift surfaced
  ↓ setup-upgrade (when framework releases something new)
framework checkout up to date
```

`setup-shared-config-sync` is orthogonal — it commits the user's
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and other shared config to a private sync
repo so a fresh dev machine can pick it up (run after editing any
file under `~/.claude-config/`).

## Cross-references

- [`docs/prerequisites.md`](/docs/quick-start/prerequisites) — what each framework
  skill needs (Claude Code, Gmail MCP, GitHub auth, browser, etc.).
