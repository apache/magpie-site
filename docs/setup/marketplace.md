There is **one Apache Magpie Marketplace**, and it is the
[`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie) repository itself. You
add it to your agent, and install plugins from it — one command per agent,
[all of them on the prerequisite page](/docs/setup/marketplace-install).

No third-party directory, no vendor "official" catalogue, and no account —
the project publishes its own marketplace and you install straight from it.

From 0.2.0 it ships the manifests each major AI coding agent needs to read
it, so the same one marketplace serves all of them; only the command to add
it differs per agent. Installing from it is the **recommended way to install
Magpie**. The [pinned snapshot install](/docs/quick-start/other-install-methods) is the fallback
for the cases it does not cover.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Two manifest families: Agent Plugins 1.0 and client-specific

Magpie ships **both** of the manifest shapes an agent may look for, because as
of 2026-08 no single one is read by every client.

**[Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification)** (published
2026-08-06 by a TSC drawn from Amazon, Cursor, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Vercel;
Google has since joined) is the vendor-neutral standard. A conformant plugin is
a directory with a root [`plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugin.json) declaring the
canonical `$schema`, plus skills in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and — optionally —
MCP servers in a root `mcp.json`. Magpie's skill tree already had exactly that
layout, so conformance needed **no file moves**: the root `plugin.json` is the
only addition.

**Client-specific manifests** stay alongside it, because the clients that
predate the standard still read their own:

| Manifest | Read by | Why it is still needed |
|---|---|---|
| [`plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugin.json) (root) | VS Code, GitHub Copilot (CLI + app + SDK) | The AP1 manifest. VS Code auto-detects the format from the root manifest and treats the `$schema` value as the AP1 marker |
| [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/.claude-plugin/plugin.json) | Claude Code (also read by VS Code) | Claude Code documents only this path, and AP1's schema is closed — it has no place for the `hooks` block or the `skills` path |
| [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) | OpenAI Codex CLI | Codex documents this as its plugin entry point, with its own `interface` / `apps` / `hooks` fields |
| [`gemini-extension.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/gemini-extension.json) | Google Gemini CLI | Gemini's extension format is unrelated to AP1; Google has announced support for the standard but not a migration for this file |
| [`apm.yml`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/apm.yml) | `microsoft/apm` | A cross-client compiler, not a client — its own package schema |

The manifests do not conflict: they sit at different paths, each client reads
the one it documents, and every one of them points at the same single `skills/`
tree. `tools/dev/check-family-plugins.py` enforces that they all carry the same
version and shared metadata, and that the AP1 manifest stays inside its closed
ten-field schema — a Claude-only key such as `skills` or `hooks` copied into it
is a **fatal** manifest error for an AP1 client, not an ignorable one.

> [!NOTE]
> **AP1 covers skills and MCP servers only.** It deliberately specifies no
> hooks, agents, commands, or marketplace/registry format. So Magpie's
> `SessionStart` upgrade prompt and its marketplace catalogs remain
> client-specific by necessity, not by choice — see
> [Automatic upgrade detection](#automatic-upgrade-detection).

## Choosing a plugin: which families

The framework ships **ten skill plugins**, one per family, and you install as
many as you want. There is no all-in-one plugin: installing everything was
never the advice, because every installed skill costs context on every turn
whether you use it or not.

Two further entries in the catalog are **substrate plugins**, which ship tooling
rather than skills and are installed independently of the choice below:
`magpie-agent-guard` (a `PreToolUse` hook that denies shell commands breaking a
hard framework rule) and `magpie-vetted-ops` (a dispatcher for fixed,
policy-scoped forge operations, so a session needs one allowlist entry instead
of a dozen wildcard `ask` rules). Both run from the installed plugin, so no
repository or worktree needs a local copy — and neither adds always-on skill
context. Pick based on the trade-off between install simplicity and
always-on token cost (each installed skill advertises a short description to
the model on **every** turn — see ["always-on" cost](#versioning) below).

Install only the families you use, and the always-on cost stays proportional
to them: `magpie-security` ≈ 2.0k tokens, `magpie-pairing` ≈ 0.2k. Mixing is
the normal case — e.g. `magpie-release-management` + `magpie-security` and
nothing else. Adding a family later is one more install.

`magpie-setup` is the exception: it installs by default wherever a catalogue
can say so, because it is the floor everything else is managed from.

| Family plugin | Skills | ~Always-on tokens |
|---|---|---|
| `magpie-security` | 15 | ~1.9k |
| `magpie-setup` | 10 | ~0.7k |
| `magpie-release-management` | 10 | ~1.3k |
| `magpie-pr-management` | 8 | ~1.0k |
| `magpie-issue` | 8 | ~0.7k |
| `magpie-repo-health` | 7 | ~0.7k |
| `magpie-utilities` | 5 | ~0.6k |
| `magpie-contributor-growth` | 6 | ~0.6k |
| `magpie-mentoring` | 4 | ~0.5k |
| `magpie-pairing` | 2 | ~0.2k |

> [!NOTE]
> **How the token column is measured.** An installed skill advertises its
> frontmatter `name` and `description` to the model on every turn; the body of
> `SKILL.md` costs nothing until the skill is actually invoked. The figures
> above are that advertised surface at ~4 characters per token. Regenerate them
> with `python3 tools/dev/estimate-skill-tokens.py`; both the counts and the
> token figures are enforced against the live frontmatter by
> `tools/dev/check-doc-sync.py`, so a stale number fails the build.

Skills are invoked under the installing plugin's namespace — e.g.
`/magpie-release-management:vote-tally`.

A family plugin owns its skills as **real directories** under
`plugins/magpie-<family>/skills/`. The flat `skills/<skill>` tree every path in
this repository has always used is the mirror: each entry is a symlink pointing
back into the plugin that owns it. Nothing is vendored and no skill exists
twice — [PRINCIPLES §13](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/PRINCIPLES.md) holds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The direction matters, and it was measured, not inferred.** It used to run
> the other way: the plugin's `skills/<skill>` was a symlink out to the shared
> tree. Agent Plugins 1.0 §4.1 says a client must reject a path resolving
> outside the plugin root, so the families were documented as a Claude Code
> feature. Installing one on Codex showed something worse than a rejection:
> Codex installs the plugin, reports success, and ships **zero skills**, with
> no error to diagnose. It also drops symlinks *wherever* they resolve —
> including inward ones §4.1 permits. A family plugin therefore has to be
> self-contained, which is what reversing the direction achieves. Measured on
> real clients: on Codex `magpie-security` installs all fifteen of its skills
> and `magpie-setup` all nine, and Gemini resolves the mirrored flat tree.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Windows.** The flat `skills/<skill>` mirror relies on git symlinks. Git for
> Windows does **not** materialise real symlinks unless `core.symlinks` is
> enabled *and* the account may create them (Windows Developer Mode, or an
> elevated shell) — otherwise the clone writes each one as a plain text file.
> The **installed plugins are unaffected**, because a family plugin carries its
> skills as real directories; only a Windows *clone of this repository* needs
> `git config --global core.symlinks true` + Developer Mode. macOS and Linux
> are unaffected either way.

## Skill names differ by install method

The **same skill** is invoked by a **different name** depending on how you
installed it. Each skill's frontmatter `name:` is its **plugin directory name**
(`vote-tally`, `issue-triage`, `setup`); the family plugin adds its namespace
with a colon, while the portable `/magpie-setup` install puts a `magpie-` prefix
on the **directory** it installs the skill under.

| Skill (flat `skills/` name) | Portable — `/magpie-setup` snapshot | Marketplace — family plugin |
|---|---|---|
| `release-vote-tally` | `/magpie-release-vote-tally` | `/magpie-release-management:vote-tally` |
| `security-issue-triage` | `/magpie-security-issue-triage` | `/magpie-security:issue-triage` |
| `setup` | `/magpie-setup` | `/magpie-setup:setup` |

Why the difference:

- **Marketplace install** — the **plugin name** is the namespace, applied with a
  **colon**: `/<plugin>:<name>`. Claude Code and Codex take `<name>` from the
  frontmatter `name:`, VS Code from the directory; the two are the same by
  construction, so every harness shows `/magpie-<family>:<alias>`.
- **Portable install** (`/magpie-setup` snapshot) — the `setup` skill symlinks
  each framework skill under a `magpie-<flat-name>` directory (e.g.
  `skills/release-vote-tally/` → `magpie-release-vote-tally`). Claude Code and
  VS Code name a repository skill after its directory, so it is invoked as a
  **single hyphenated token**, `/magpie-<flat-name>`; the prefix keeps framework
  skills from clashing with the adopter's own. The listing shows **shorter
  names** than the command, though: Claude Code uses a repository skill's
  frontmatter `name:` as its display label, so the `/` menu shows
  `vote-tally` beside `/magpie-release-vote-tally` — the same for a
  self-adopted framework checkout. Harnesses that name skills by
  frontmatter instead show the alias there: Codex as `magpie-<family>:<alias>`
  (it resolves the symlink back to the family plugin that owns the skill),
  Gemini CLI as the bare alias.
- **Why the aliases.** `magpie-security` + `security-issue-triage` would read
  `/magpie-security:security-issue-triage`, saying "security" twice. <!-- allow-stutter -->
  The family plugin owns each skill as a real directory named by the alias, and
  the flat `skills/<name>` tree mirrors it back with the family prefix kept.
  The rule lives in `plugin_alias()` in
  [`tools/dev/check-family-plugins.py`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/dev/check-family-plugins.py),
  which also requires every alias to be unique across **all** families —
  Gemini CLI registers skills by `name:` in one flat namespace, which is why the
  pull-request family's are `pr-triage` and `pr-stale-sweep` rather than a
  second `triage` and `stale-sweep`. `check-doc-sync.py` fails any doc that
  invokes a stuttering form, and the skill validator fails any `name:` that
  differs from its directory, as the Agent Skills specification requires.

**Which form the docs use.** Magpie's user-facing docs — the
[quick start](/docs/quick-start), the family READMEs, the top-level README —
use the **family-plugin** form, because a marketplace install is the
recommended path. The skills themselves refer to each other by **bare skill
name** rather than any slash command, since a skill cannot know which way the
reader installed it. If you are on the snapshot install, translate
`/<plugin>:<alias>` to the single token `/magpie-<directory-name>` using the
table above — note it is the **directory** name, not the alias.

## Supported agents

Every agent below adds the **same** Apache Magpie Marketplace — the
[`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie) repository. What differs
is only the command each one uses to add it and the manifest it reads. Pin to
a released tag (e.g. `0.2.0`) for reproducibility, or track `main` for the
latest.

Quick reference:

| Agent | One-liner | Manifest in this repo |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie` → `/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie` | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | `codex plugin marketplace add apache/magpie` → install `magpie-setup` | `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; per plugin root, whichever manifest [resolution](#which-manifest-codex-reads) picks |
| **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** | install straight from the repo URL `https://github.com/apache/magpie`, or add it as a plugin marketplace | root `plugin.json` (AP1), `marketplace.json` (repo root) |
| **Google Gemini CLI** | `gemini extensions install https://github.com/apache/magpie` | `gemini-extension.json` |
| **Cursor** | add via the plugin/skill install flow pointing at the repo | root `plugin.json` (AP1) |
| **microsoft/apm** | `apm install apache/magpie` (compiles to Claude/Cursor/Codex/Copilot/Gemini) | `apm.yml` |
| **Kiro** | install per-skill from a GitHub subdirectory, or the AP1 package | root `plugin.json` (AP1), native `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **OpenCode** | clone skills into `.opencode/skills/`, or use a community installer | native `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **JetBrains IDEs** (IntelliJ, PyCharm, …) | nothing of its own — install for the agent you run inside the IDE, e.g. Claude Code's `/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie` | none; a host, not a distribution target |

Detailed steps per agent follow.

### Claude Code

Commands: [**Prerequisite → Claude Code**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#claude-code).

Adding the marketplace clones the repo and reads
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; installing a family reads that family's
`plugin.json`. Skills then arrive under the plugin namespace, e.g.
`/magpie-release-management:vote-tally`.

**Updating** is `/plugin marketplace update apache-magpie` followed by
`/plugin update magpie-<family>@apache-magpie` for each family you installed.
On a version change the `magpie-setup` plugin's bundled `SessionStart` hook
also prompts you to run `/magpie-setup upgrade`.

Adding the marketplace from a tag rather than untagged pins which version the
install tracks — see [Versioning](#versioning).

### OpenAI Codex CLI

Commands: [**Prerequisite → OpenAI Codex CLI**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#openai-codex-cli).

Adding the marketplace reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.

#### Which manifest Codex reads

Not `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` by default, which is what this page used to
say. Codex resolves a manifest **per plugin root**, in this order:

1. The plugin root's own `plugin.json`, taken when it is a **regular file**
   whose `$schema` sits under `https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/`.
2. Otherwise, the first of `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` that exists.

When step 1 wins, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` is not ignored — it is merged
over the root manifest as an **overlay**, so it carries Codex-specific fields
rather than the whole manifest.

For this repo that resolves two different ways:

| Installed root | Manifest Codex actually reads |
|---|---|
| the repo root | root [`plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugin.json) — its AP1 `$schema` matches — with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` merged over it |
| `plugins/magpie-<family>/` | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, reached by fallback: those roots carry neither a `plugin.json` nor a `.codex-plugin/` |

The second row is why the ten family plugins install into Codex at all despite
carrying only a Claude-Code manifest.

> [!WARNING]
> A plugin root's `plugin.json` must be a regular file. If it is a **symlink**,
> Codex's resolver returns no manifest at all — it does *not* fall back to
> `.codex-plugin/` or `.claude-plugin/`, and the plugin silently fails to load.
> Keep the root manifest a real file when restructuring the tree.

Verified against Codex's source rather than its prose docs, which carry no
plugins page: `find_plugin_manifest_path` in
[`codex-rs/utils/plugins/src/plugin_namespace.rs`][codex-resolve],
`DISCOVERABLE_PLUGIN_MANIFEST_PATHS` in
[`codex-rs/exec-server-protocol/src/protocol.rs`][codex-paths], and the overlay
merge in [`codex-rs/core-plugins/src/manifest.rs`][codex-overlay]. The
plugin-authoring reference now ships inside the CLI as skill assets under
[`codex-rs/skills/src/assets/samples/plugin-creator/references/`][codex-refs].

[codex-resolve]: https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/utils/plugins/src/plugin_namespace.rs
[codex-paths]: https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/exec-server-protocol/src/protocol.rs
[codex-overlay]: https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/core-plugins/src/manifest.rs
[codex-refs]: https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs/skills/src/assets/samples/plugin-creator/references

All ten family plugins are offered here, and `magpie-setup` installs by
default: a family plugin carries its skills as real directories, so Codex
installs them intact (measured — `magpie-security` gives 15 of 15). The
catalogue is checked against the live `family:` frontmatter by
`tools/dev/check-family-plugins.py`, so it cannot drift into advertising a
family that does not exist or omitting one that does.

> Codex's plugin/marketplace verbs are still evolving. If a command name
> differs, check `codex plugin --help`.

### VS Code and GitHub Copilot

Agent Plugins 1.0 support is generally available in VS Code, Copilot CLI, the
Copilot app, and the Copilot SDK on all Copilot plans. VS Code auto-detects the
plugin format from the root manifest, and Magpie's root
[`plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugin.json) declares the AP1 `$schema`, so it is loaded
as an AP1 package. Two ways in:

Commands: [**Prerequisite → VS Code / GitHub Copilot**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#vs-code--github-copilot).

Two ways in, and they read different files: installing straight from the repo
URL needs no marketplace at all, while adding `apache/magpie` as a plugin
marketplace reads the root [`marketplace.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/marketplace.json).

Either way the skills become available to the agent under the plugin that ships
them. As with Codex, all ten families are offered.

> [!NOTE]
> VS Code **ignores client extension data and directories** in an AP1 package.
> Magpie's `.claude-plugin/` hook block is therefore inert here — the upgrade
> prompt is Claude Code-only (see
> [Automatic upgrade detection](#automatic-upgrade-detection)). Existing
> Copilot plugins that do not target AP1 remain supported, so the root
> `marketplace.json` keeps working regardless.

### Google Gemini CLI

Commands: [**Prerequisite → Google Gemini CLI**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#google-gemini-cli).

The install reads `gemini-extension.json` and auto-discovers the skills under
`skills/`. Invoke them by asking the agent in natural language or by skill
name.

Gemini has no lifecycle hook, so the shipped
[`GEMINI.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/GEMINI.md) reminds you to run `/magpie-setup upgrade` when
the version changes.

### Cursor

Commands: [**Prerequisite → Cursor**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#cursor).

Cursor is one of the Agent Plugins 1.0 launch clients (and sits on the spec's
TSC), so it reads the root [`plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugin.json).

> Confirm the exact add flow in Cursor's current docs — its self-serve
> marketplace surface is evolving.

### microsoft/apm (multiplexer)

`apm` compiles one package to several agents at once (Claude, Cursor, Codex,
Copilot, Gemini).

Commands: [**Prerequisite → microsoft/apm**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#microsoftapm).

The install reads `apm.yml` (`type: skill`), deploys the skills into each
supported agent's directory, and writes an `apm.lock.yaml` — commit it to pin
the exact resolved commit.

> `apm` schema is **v0.1** and may change; verify verbs with `apm --help`.

### Kiro (AWS)

Kiro installs skills **per-skill from a GitHub subdirectory** (it does not
consume the repo root). For each skill you want, point Kiro's "install from
GitHub" at that skill's subdir on a pinned tag, e.g.:

```text
https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/0.2.0/skills/release-vote-tally
```

Kiro reads the `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` there.

### OpenCode

OpenCode reads native Agent Skills from `.opencode/skills/`. Either:

- clone the skill directories you want into `.opencode/skills/` (project) or
  `~/.opencode/skills/` (personal) from `github.com/apache/magpie`, or
- use a community installer (e.g. the `opencode-skills-collection` npm
  package) pointed at this repo.

### JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, GoLand, …)

A JetBrains IDE is a **host for an agent, not a distribution target of its
own** — which is why it appears in no table above and ships no manifest in this
repo. Nothing here needs installing *for* IntelliJ; you install for the agent
you run inside it.

With the **Claude Code plugin for JetBrains**, the install is the ordinary
Claude Code one, run from the IDE's Claude Code window —
[**Prerequisite → JetBrains IDEs**](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#jetbrains-ides).

You do not have to run it twice. Claude Code keeps its plugin state in one
user-scope store — `~/.claude/plugins/` (`known_marketplaces.json` and
`installed_plugins.json`) — and every host that launches the same CLI reads it:
the terminal, the VS Code extension, and the JetBrains plugin alike. Install
from any one of them and the skills are there in the others. The same holds for
the [auto-install](#auto-install-arriving-magpie-ready) block: it lives in the
project's `.claude/settings.json`, so opening that project in IntelliJ picks it
up exactly as opening it in a terminal does.

Project-scope installs are keyed by the project's **path**, so a repo opened at
the same path in the IDE and in a terminal shares them; a second clone
elsewhere is a separate project and installs separately.

> [!NOTE]
> This is about running *Claude Code* (or another agent with a JetBrains
> plugin) inside a JetBrains IDE. **JetBrains' own agent, Junie, is a separate
> harness port** — tracked as
> [#321](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/321) and listed *Not yet
> ported* in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
> [`vendor-neutrality.md`](/docs/vendor-neutrality). Junie does not read
> Magpie's skills today.

### Not supported

- **Windsurf** — has no skills/rules marketplace; project rules are plain
  `.windsurfrules` files with no install mechanism. Skills would have to be
  converted by hand; there is no distribution channel.
- **Goose (Block)** — its extension registry is Model Context Protocol
  (MCP) servers, not `SKILL.md` skills. Distributing Magpie there would
  require wrapping skills behind an MCP server (a rebuild, not packaging).

## Auto-install: arriving Magpie-ready

Everything above is a person typing an install command. A project can instead
commit the wiring, so a contributor who clones it and opens their agent finds
Magpie already there. **Only Claude Code can actually do this**, and the
difference is structural rather than a gap someone forgot to fill.

### What each harness supports

| Harness | Auto-install | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ per-family | `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins` in the project's `.claude/settings.json` |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | ✅ the floor | `policy.installation: "INSTALLED_BY_DEFAULT"` on `magpie-setup` in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; every other family stays `AVAILABLE` |
| **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** | ❌ | No repo-side mechanism. The catalogue advertises; it cannot pre-install |
| **Google Gemini CLI** | ❌ | Install is explicit-only. Gemini does **not** load a workspace `.gemini/extensions/` directory — verified against the CLI, which reports "No extensions installed" for a repo-local extension |
| **JetBrains IDEs** | ✅ inherited | Whatever the agent running inside the IDE supports. With Claude Code's JetBrains plugin that is the row above — the project's `.claude/settings.json` applies unchanged, because plugin state is one user-scope store shared by every host of the same CLI |

Codex's `INSTALLED_BY_DEFAULT` is per-plugin, so it can express exactly the
floor this page argues for: `magpie-setup` arrives installed, every other
family stays `AVAILABLE` and opt-in. That only became possible once each family
carried its own skills — while the all-in-one existed, defaulting it on meant
defaulting *everything* on. `check-family-plugins.py` fails the build if either
value drifts.

> [!WARNING]
> Codex parses its catalogue strictly and its policy values are closed
> SCREAMING_SNAKE enums (`NOT_AVAILABLE` / `AVAILABLE` /
> `INSTALLED_BY_DEFAULT`, and `ON_INSTALL` / `ON_USE` for the optional
> `authentication`). An unknown variant does not mis-label the plugin — it
> makes `codex plugin marketplace add` reject the **whole file**, so nothing
> installs. This catalogue shipped invented values (`manual`, `none`) for a
> release before anyone ran the command.

### Claude Code: the default set

Add to the project's `.claude/settings.json` — committed, so it applies to
everyone who trusts the repo:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "apache-magpie": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "apache/magpie" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "magpie-setup@apache-magpie": true,
    "magpie-utilities@apache-magpie": true,
    "magpie-agent-guard@apache-magpie": true
  }
}

Three plugins, for two different reasons.

`setup` and `utilities` are the framework's two **always-on families** — the
same pair the pinned-snapshot install wires unconditionally, with no way to ask
for them or opt out. Between them a newcomer gets `/magpie-setup` to adopt and
maintain the framework and `/magpie-utilities:list-skills` to discover
everything else, at the smallest always-on cost. Every other family stays
opt-in, which is the point.

`magpie-agent-guard` is not a family at all — it is a
[substrate plugin](#choosing-a-plugin-which-families), a `PreToolUse`
hook that denies shell commands which would break a hard framework rule
(pinging maintainers, a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, marking a PR ready
prematurely, leaking security language onto a public thread, emptying a PR via
force-push). It is in the default set because a guard nobody remembered to
install guards nothing: it costs no always-on context — it is a hook, not
skills — and it is most valuable in exactly the sessions where nobody was
thinking about it. It only ever *denies*, so the failure mode of having it on
is a blocked command with a stated reason, not a silent action.

> [!NOTE]
> The guard runs from the installed plugin, so no repository or worktree needs
> a local copy — and a contributor who has not enabled it is not protected by

Pin the marketplace to a released tag by using `"repo": "apache/magpie@0.2.0"`
if the project would rather not track `main`.

Contributors keep the last word: a plugin enabled this way still appears in
`/plugin`, and anyone can disable it locally.

## Automatic upgrade detection

When the marketplace updates the plugin to a new version, Magpie prompts you
to run **`/magpie-setup upgrade`** — which reconciles the gitignored snapshot,
the agentic overrides, and drift. This is **detect-and-prompt, not auto-run**:
a plugin hook cannot invoke a slash command, and Magpie never mutates an
adopter repo without the guided skill's confirmation, so the *trigger* is
automatic while the *changes* stay confirmed.

| Agent | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `SessionStart` hook [`plugins/magpie-setup/hooks/check-upgrade.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/hooks/check-upgrade.sh) compares the installed version to a marker in the plugin's persistent data dir and prompts on change. Deterministic. |
| **Codex CLI** | The same [`plugins/magpie-setup/hooks/check-upgrade.sh`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/hooks/check-upgrade.sh), wired inline via the plugin's `hooks` block — Codex uses the same event schema and the same `SessionStart` event. Codex sets `PLUGIN_ROOT`/`PLUGIN_DATA` (and the `CLAUDE_*` pair for compatibility), which the script reads. See the caveat below. |
| **VS Code / Copilot, Cursor, Kiro (AP1)** | None. Agent Plugins 1.0 specifies no hook component and VS Code ignores client extension directories, so there is nothing to fire. Re-run `/magpie-setup upgrade` after updating. |
| **Gemini CLI** | No lifecycle hook; the extension context file [`GEMINI.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/GEMINI.md) instructs the agent to compare the extension version to a recorded marker and prompt on change (LLM-driven, advisory). |
| Other agents | Re-run `/magpie-setup upgrade` manually after updating the package. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Codex plugin-local hooks may not fire yet.** [openai/codex#16430](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16430)
> reports that the runtime executes only the global `hooks.json` even though the
> plugin docs describe plugin-local hooks. The manifest is written to the
> documented schema so it starts working when the runtime catches up; until
> then, treat the Codex upgrade prompt as best-effort and re-run
> `/magpie-setup upgrade` manually.

The hook writes its prompt to **stdout**, which is what a `SessionStart` hook
exiting 0 has added to the session context — stderr on a zero exit reaches only
the debug log. It is read-only apart from writing its own version marker, which
goes to the client-provided persistent data directory (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` /
`PLUGIN_DATA`), falling back to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/magpie` — never inside the
plugin checkout, which a plugin update may replace wholesale. It makes no
network calls and touches nothing in the adopter repo.

### Reconciliation when a skill first runs after an upgrade

`marketplace update`, `plugin update` and auto-update are all you need to get new skills onto your machine.
They replace the plugin files and nothing else.
They do not check whether your project's configuration and overrides still match the new skills.
Magpie does that itself, when you run a skill, so you have no extra step to remember.

Every skill runs a short self-check in its pre-flight.
It compares the skill's current configuration surface (its `surface_hash`) with the value recorded when this project was last reconciled.
That value is kept in the `reconciled:` stamp: in the committed `.apache-magpie.lock` if the project is adopted, or in the gitignored `.apache-magpie-local/reconciled.json` if you have only configured it
(format in [`locks.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/skills/setup/locks.md#the-reconciled-block--what-was-checked-not-what-to-install)).
Nothing is fetched over the network, and a skill whose surface has not changed stays silent.

After an upgrade, the first run of a changed skill is where reconciliation happens:

- **The skill changed since the last reconciliation**, for example a new `requires_config` entry or a moved anchor that one of your overrides points at.
  The skill shows the matching ⚠ and proposes the fix, then carries on with what you asked it to do.
  The warning is shown once per change and comes back only if the skill changes again.
- **The project has never been reconciled** (it has no stamp yet).
  The skill proposes a project-wide sweep instead.
  This proposal is shown once per installed version, not once per skill.

Nothing is changed without your confirmation.
The check only detects and proposes.
Applying a fix and writing the new stamp are left to `setup`, which asks you first.

**To reconcile on demand**, without waiting for a skill to notice, run:

```text
/magpie-setup:setup reconcile
```

(`/magpie-setup reconcile` on a pinned-snapshot install.)
This checks anchors and `requires_config` for every skill the project configures or overrides, proposes each fix separately, and writes a fresh stamp.
It works with every install method.
Add `dry-run` to see the report without changing anything.
It is worth running right after a large upgrade, or before other contributors pick up the new version.
Mechanics: [`reconcile.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/plugins/magpie-setup/skills/setup/reconcile.md).

**The isolated setup is checked in the same pre-flight.**
If you use the [secure agent setup](/docs/setup/secure-agent-setup) on this machine, the first skill you run after an upgrade that changed its files (the sandbox wrapper and helper scripts, agent-guard, the container gateway, the dogfooded `.claude/settings.json`) proposes `/magpie-setup:isolated-setup-update`.
The same suggestion also comes back weekly by default, and the interval can be changed.
Run the skill directly at any time to check now.

## Versioning

The plugin version tracks the framework version in `pyproject.toml`, which is
the single authority every manifest mirrors verbatim — **including the `.devN`
suffix**. Between releases the manifests therefore read
`0.2.0.dev<YYYYMMDDHHMM>`, not `0.2.0`: a bare `0.2.0` would advertise a
release that does not exist yet. Only a tagged release carries a bare version.

**The dev suffix is a UTC timestamp, and it has to move for adopters to pick
anything up.** This marketplace is served straight from the `main` branch of a
git repo, so consumers *do* install dev versions — the suffix reaching them is
the normal case, not the exception. `claude plugin update` compares version
strings, not commit SHAs: while the suffix stays frozen at a constant like
`.dev0`, an adopter's `claude plugin update` answers "already at the latest
version" and never moves the pinned commit, however far behind `main` the
installed copy has fallen. Their only recovery is
`claude plugin marketplace update` followed by a full uninstall + reinstall of
every plugin, which nobody discovers on their own.

The adopter's half of this is auto-update, and it is **off by default** for
`apache-magpie` because Claude Code disables it for third-party marketplaces.
A stamp that moves reaches nobody whose client never refreshes the catalogue, so
[the install guide](/docs/setup/marketplace-install#claude-code) tells adopters to turn it
on, and the same page covers the equivalent for Gemini (`--auto-update`), Codex
(manual `marketplace upgrade`) and `apm` (lockfile by design).

**When to bump.** Not every PR — that would put every contributor in conflict
with every other over one line, for no gain on changes nobody is waiting for.
Bump when the work needs to reach installed copies: before pointing anyone at
`claude plugin update`, before announcing a change adopters should take, or
when a batch of merged work has piled up behind a stale stamp.

**How to bump.** From the Actions tab: **bump dev version** -> *Run workflow*.
[`bump-dev-version.yml`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/.github/workflows/bump-dev-version.yml) runs the
three steps below, puts the result through the same checks a pull request gets,
and opens it as a **draft PR** crediting whoever pressed the button. Review the
diff, press *Ready for review* to start the required checks, then merge.
`workflow_dispatch` is restricted by GitHub to accounts with write access, so
the button is committers-only. See
[Running the dev loop](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-dev-loop) for why it is
a draft and what each job does.

It is manual on purpose: *when* a bump is wanted is the judgement above, not
something a merge trigger can make. The same three steps still work by hand for
a release or a local experiment —
[`bump-dev-version.py`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/tools/dev/bump-dev-version.py), then
`check-family-plugins.py --fix` and `uv lock`.

The stamp is minute-resolution and **UTC**, not local time: a repo with
contributors in several timezones needs the string to sort in the order the
bumps were actually made, and a date alone would collide whenever a day carries
more than one.

Nothing is hand-edited. `pyproject.toml` feeds the four ecosystem manifests,
and [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/.claude-plugin/plugin.json) — kept as
the metadata anchor — in turn feeds the ten per-family manifests and the marketplace entries, which
also inherit `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, and `license`. Bump
`project.version` and run `python3 tools/dev/check-family-plugins.py --fix`; the
same script runs as a prek hook in `--fix` mode, so a manifest left behind at
the old version is regenerated in place and the run fails until the corrected
file is staged. See
[`release-management-config.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/projects/magpie/release-management-config.md)
(`version_manifest_files`).

## Verification status

Every manifest here has been checked against the vendor's **published
documentation**; what varies is whether it has also been exercised against a
**live install**.

| Manifest | Schema source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| root `plugin.json` | [Agent Plugins 1.0.0 spec](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec/blob/main/spec/1.0.0.md) + [`plugin.schema.json`](https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json) | Conforms to the published closed schema; enforced by `check-family-plugins.py`. Also the manifest Codex resolves first for the repo root — see [Which manifest Codex reads](#which-manifest-codex-reads) |
| `.claude-plugin/*` | Claude Code plugins reference | Verified live — `claude plugin validate . --strict` passes with 0 warnings; a family plugin installs and loads from a local marketplace replica |
| `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | The `codex` binary's own source and enums — Codex no longer publishes a plugins page under `docs/`, so the manifest-resolution order is read from [`plugin_namespace.rs`][codex-resolve] and [`protocol.rs`][codex-paths] | **Verified live** — `codex plugin marketplace add` + `plugin list` against codex 0.154.0. The first live run is what caught the invented `policy` values the documentation check could not; the enums are now enforced by `check-family-plugins.py`. Note `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` is an **overlay** on the root manifest, not the manifest itself. See the plugin-local hooks caveat above |
| root `marketplace.json` | Copilot / VS Code plugin marketplace docs | Legacy-format catalog, explicitly still supported alongside AP1. Not yet live-installed |
| `gemini-extension.json` | Gemini CLI extensions docs | Follows the published schema. Google has joined the AP1 TSC but has published no migration for this file — keep both |
| `apm.yml` | `microsoft/apm` schema **v0.1** | Pre-1.0 and the most likely to churn; re-check before publish |

The skills themselves are checked against the
[Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), which AP1
defers to. Worth stating explicitly, because it looks like a problem and is
not: 45 of the 74 `description` fields contain the framework's
`<placeholder>` syntax (`<tracker>`, `<upstream>`, …). The spec constrains
`description` on **length only** — 1–1024 characters, non-empty — and places no
restriction on angle brackets; the character-class rules apply to `name`, which
every skill satisfies. So the placeholders are conformant, not a portability
risk to design around.

Re-check each against the vendor's current documentation before a marketplace
publish. Manifests that fail live validation should be fixed here and
re-released — none of them change how the ASF source release is built or
signed.
