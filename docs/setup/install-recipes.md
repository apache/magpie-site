> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Skill names differ on this install.** Installed from the pinned snapshot
> (or self-adoption), a skill is invoked as a **single token** —
> `/magpie-security-issue-triage` — not `/magpie-security:issue-triage`. There
> is no plugin namespace here; the `magpie-` prefix *is* the namespace, and the
> name is the skill's directory name. Magpie's other docs show the
> marketplace form; see
> [Skill names differ by install method](/docs/setup/marketplaces#skill-names-differ-by-install-method).

Three copy-pasteable shell recipes for fetching the framework
into a new adopter project's repo. Each recipe is **the
bootstrap that gets `setup` into the repo**; once it is
in place, the rest of the adoption (skill-family pick, framework
symlinks, project doc note, gitignored runtime state) runs
through `/magpie-setup` interactively.

Pick the recipe that matches your distribution preference:

| Method | When to use | Reproducibility |
|---|---|---|
| [**svn-zip**](#method-1--released-zip-from-asf-distribution) | **Recommended for production adopters.** Signed + checksummed zip from the ASF distribution area; `0.1.0` is the current release. | Frozen by version |
| [**git-tag**](#method-2--git-tag) | Pinning a specific framework version (e.g. for testing a release candidate, or for a cautious adopter who tracks named releases only). | Frozen by tag |
| [**git-branch**](#method-3--git-branch-defaults-to-main) | WIP path — track the framework's `main` branch directly for the latest unreleased changes. | Tracks branch tip |

> **Canonical layout — no per-project convention to pick.**
> `.agents/skills/` is the one canonical home (see
> [`agents.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup/agents.md)). Copy `setup` into
> `.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`, then add a relay symlink to it
> from every agent-specific dir you use
> (`.claude/skills/magpie-setup` and `.github/skills/magpie-setup`
> → `../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup`). This is the same for
> every adopter regardless of how `.claude/` / `.github/` were
> previously organised.
>
> The `setup` skill itself is the **only** framework
> artefact you commit. Every other framework skill is wired
> in by the `setup adopt` flow as gitignored symlinks —
> canonical in `.agents/skills/`, relayed everywhere else.

## Method 1 — released zip from ASF distribution

> **Status: recommended.** ASF release distribution
> (`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/magpie/`)
> is the canonical home for ASF-blessed releases per the
> [release-policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)
> and [infra release-distribution guidelines](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html).
> Magpie ships there from `0.1.0` onwards, so this is the path
> production adopters should take.

```bash
# === Magpie bootstrap — Method 1: signed zip from ASF dist ===
# Replace <VERSION> with the framework version you want (e.g. 0.1.0).
# Released versions are listed at
# https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/magpie/

cd /path/to/your/repo

VERSION=<VERSION>
# KEYS lives at the project root of the dist area; the artefacts live
# under a per-version subdirectory.
DIST_BASE=https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/magpie
REL_BASE=${DIST_BASE}/${VERSION}
ZIP=apache-magpie-${VERSION}-source.zip

# 1. Download zip + signature + checksum, verify, extract to .apache-magpie/
curl -fsSLO ${REL_BASE}/${ZIP}
curl -fsSLO ${REL_BASE}/${ZIP}.sha512
curl -fsSLO ${REL_BASE}/${ZIP}.asc
sha512sum -c ${ZIP}.sha512
# Optional but recommended — verify the OpenPGP signature against the
# project KEYS file (see https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html):
#   curl -fsSLO ${DIST_BASE}/KEYS
#   gpg --import KEYS
#   gpg --verify ${ZIP}.asc ${ZIP}

mkdir -p .apache-magpie
unzip -q ${ZIP} -d .apache-magpie
mv .apache-magpie/apache-magpie-${VERSION}/* \
   .apache-magpie/apache-magpie-${VERSION}/.[!.]* \
   .apache-magpie/ 2>/dev/null
rmdir .apache-magpie/apache-magpie-${VERSION}
rm -f ${ZIP} ${ZIP}.sha512 ${ZIP}.asc

# 2. Copy the `setup` skill into the canonical .agents/skills/,
#    then relay it from each agent-specific dir you use.
mkdir -p .agents/skills .claude/skills .github/skills
cp -r .apache-magpie/skills/setup .agents/skills/magpie-setup
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup .claude/skills/magpie-setup
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup .github/skills/magpie-setup
#    (Drop the .claude or .github relay if you don't use that agent;
#     add the same `ln -sf` line for any holdout like .windsurf/skills.)

# 3. Add gitignore entries (idempotent — re-run is safe)
cat >> .gitignore <<'GITIGNORE'

# Magpie — gitignored snapshot of the framework, refreshed
# by /magpie-setup upgrade. Build artefact, not source. No trailing
# slash: worktree-init makes this a symlink to the main checkout's
# snapshot, and a directory-only pattern would not match it.
/.apache-magpie

# Per-machine local-pin file. Records what THIS machine fetched and
# when. Compared against the committed .apache-magpie.lock to
# detect drift.
/.apache-magpie.local.lock

# Byte-compiled artefacts emitted when framework skill scripts run
# from this checkout. Non-anchored so they match at any depth.
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# (No agent-guard entries. The deterministic PreToolUse guard runs
# from the install — the magpie-agent-guard plugin, or a
# settings.local.json entry resolving the engine inside the snapshot
# — so nothing repository-local exists to ignore, and no worktree
# needs seeding. Repos adopted before that change can drop their
# leftover /.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py and /.claude/hooks/guards.d/
# lines along with the files.)

# Framework-skill symlinks created by /magpie-setup. One uniform
# block per skills dir you use: the `magpie-*` glob ignores them
# all (their targets are the gitignored snapshot, so they would
# dangle on a fresh clone), and the `!…/magpie-setup` negation keeps
# the one committed bootstrap tracked. .agents/skills/ is canonical;
# the rest are relays into it. Drop any block for a dir you don't use.
/.agents/skills/magpie-*
!/.agents/skills/magpie-setup
/.claude/skills/magpie-*
!/.claude/skills/magpie-setup
/.github/skills/magpie-*
!/.github/skills/magpie-setup
GITIGNORE

# 4. Tell your agent: "follow /magpie-setup to finish adopting Magpie."
#    The skill will write .apache-magpie.lock (committed) and
#    .apache-magpie.local.lock (gitignored), ask which skill family
#    to wire up, create the gitignored framework-skill symlinks, and
#    update your project docs.
```

## Method 2 — git tag

```bash
# === Magpie bootstrap — Method 2: pinned git tag ===
# Replace <TAG> with the framework tag you want
# (e.g. `v1.0.0` once tags exist on apache/magpie).

cd /path/to/your/repo

TAG=<TAG>
git clone --depth=1 \
    --branch ${TAG} \
    https://github.com/apache/magpie.git \
    .apache-magpie

# Copy the `setup` skill to canonical + relays (see Method 1 step 2)
mkdir -p .agents/skills .claude/skills .github/skills
cp -r .apache-magpie/skills/setup .agents/skills/magpie-setup
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup .claude/skills/magpie-setup
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup .github/skills/magpie-setup

# Add gitignore entries (same block as Method 1 step 3 — see there)

# Tell your agent: "follow /magpie-setup to finish adopting Magpie."
```

---

## Method 3 — git branch (defaults to `main`)

The default WIP path while the framework is pre-release.

```bash
# === Magpie bootstrap — Method 3: git branch (default: main) ===
cd /path/to/your/repo

BRANCH=main   # or another branch you want to track
git clone --depth=1 \
    --branch ${BRANCH} \
    https://github.com/apache/magpie.git \
    .apache-magpie

# Copy the `setup` skill to canonical + relays (see Method 1 step 2)
mkdir -p .agents/skills .claude/skills .github/skills
cp -r .apache-magpie/skills/setup .agents/skills/magpie-setup
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup .claude/skills/magpie-setup
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup .github/skills/magpie-setup

# Add gitignore entries (same block as Method 1 step 3 — see there)

# Tell your agent: "follow /magpie-setup to finish adopting Magpie."
```

## After any recipe — let the skill take over

Once the recipe completes, `setup` is in your repo and
the snapshot is on disk (gitignored). Tell your agent:

```text
follow .agents/skills/magpie-setup to adopt Magpie
```

(or invoke `/magpie-setup` directly). The skill walks through
the rest:

1. **Pick the skill families** to symlink in (`security`,
   `pr-management`, `issue`).
2. **Write the lock files**:
   - `.apache-magpie.lock` (**committed**) — the project's pin
     (the method + URL + ref you used in the recipe). Future
     adopters of *this same repo* re-install per this pin.
   - `.apache-magpie.local.lock` (**gitignored**) — what THIS
     machine actually fetched (commit SHA, timestamp).
3. **Create the symlinks** for chosen skill families
   (gitignored — they target the gitignored snapshot).
4. **Scaffold `.apache-magpie-overrides/`** (committed) for
   any local workflow modifications.
5. **Install a `post-checkout` git hook** so worktrees
   re-create the gitignored runtime state.
6. **Update your project documentation** with a brief mention
   of the framework adoption.

After this, adopters fresh-cloning the repo can run
`/magpie-setup` and get the framework provisioned per your
project's committed `.apache-magpie.lock` — no need to redo
the manual recipe.

## Subsequent runs and drift detection

Every framework skill — and `/magpie-setup verify` —
compares the local lock against the committed lock at the top
of its run. If they have drifted (e.g. the project lead bumped
`.apache-magpie.lock` to a newer ref, or the local install is
stale on a `main`-tracking adopter), the skill surfaces the
gap and proposes:

```text
/magpie-setup upgrade
```

`upgrade` deletes the gitignored snapshot, re-installs per the
committed lock, refreshes the gitignored symlinks (adding any
new framework skills, removing any that were renamed away),
and updates the local lock. See
[`setup/upgrade.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/skills/setup/upgrade.md)
for the full flow.
