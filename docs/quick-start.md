Install Apache Magpie into the agent you already use, in a couple of
commands: one to add the marketplace, one per family you want. Nothing is
committed to your repository, and nothing is changed in it.

**This install is yours, on this machine.** It needs no decision from your
project and no opt-in from your teammates — see
[per user or per project](#per-user-or-per-project) if you are wondering
which is which.

**What you get.** 74 skills your agent can run, grouped into 10 **families** —
PR triage and review, issue triage, security-report handling, release
management, contributor mentoring. Install only the families you need; each one
you add costs context in every session.

---

## What each family solves

Skills ship in ten **families**. Install the ones that match a problem you have
today — you are not meant to take all of them.

| Plugin | Skills | The problem it solves | What it offers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `magpie-setup` | 9 | Your agent can read every credential on your machine, and you have no way to tell whether it is sandboxed right now. | A filesystem sandbox, a clean-env wrapper, a status line that shows sandbox state, and a red banner before any bypass. Plus install, upgrade, and drift checks. **Take this one.** |
| `magpie-security` | 15 | Security reports arrive by mail and must be triaged, fixed, and disclosed on a clock — with nothing leaking early. | A 16-step lifecycle: intake from the mailbox, validity triage, canned responses, fix drafting, CVE allocation, advisory and publication. Drafts land in Gmail; nothing is ever sent for you. |
| `magpie-release-management` | 10 | An ASF release is a long checklist where one missed step invalidates the vote. | RC cut, RC verification (signatures, hashes, LICENSE/NOTICE, no stray binaries), the `[VOTE]` thread, the tally, promotion, `[ANNOUNCE]`, archive sweep, audit log. The agent never holds your signing key and never publishes. |
| `magpie-pr-management` | 8 | The PR queue grows faster than you can read it, and the oldest ones quietly rot. | Queue triage into ready / needs-review / waiting-on-author, deep code review with blocking vs non-blocking findings, reviewer routing, express-lane merge, stale sweep, and queue statistics. |
| `magpie-issue` | 8 | A backlog full of duplicates, unreproducible reports, and issues nobody has read in a year. | Triage with proposed labels, duplicate clustering, reproduction attempts across versions, fix drafting, reassessment of old issues, stale sweep, and backlog stats. |
| `magpie-repo-health` | 7 | Slow rot you only notice when it breaks: vulnerable deps, unpinned actions, licence drift, flaky tests. | Read-only audits for dependency CVEs, dependency licences, LICENSE/NOTICE compliance, Actions workflow security, obsolete runner labels, and flaky-test patterns — plus a skill that fixes what they find. |
| `magpie-contributor-growth` | 6 | Contributors who have earned committership go unnoticed because nobody is tracking the signal. | Activity sweeps against a review threshold, readiness tracking, sentiment signals, nomination briefs for the PMC, and committer / post-vote onboarding checklists. |
| `magpie-utilities` | 5 | You want to write your own skills, or find out what is actually installed. | Skill authoring and restructuring, a state reconciler, a live index of installed skills, and a path to report framework bugs upstream. |
| `magpie-mentoring` | 4 | Newcomers open one PR, hit a wall of unwritten conventions, and never come back. | First-contact welcome comments, plain-language explanations of an issue for someone new, good-first-issue authoring, and a sweep that keeps that backlog honest. |
| `magpie-pairing` | 2 | You want the obvious problems found before a reviewer spends their time on them. | A structured self-review of your own diff, and a multi-agent adversarial review that verifies its findings before reporting them. |

## Step 1 — install from your agent's marketplace

Pick your agent. Every path uses the
[`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie) repository directly as
the marketplace; no vendor directory or account is involved.

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace, then install **one plugin per family you actually want**:

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie
/plugin install magpie-pr-management@apache-magpie
```

`magpie-setup` is the one to always take — it carries the secure-isolation
skills from [the next section](#what-happens-next--the-secure-isolation-setup).
Add the rest to match a problem you have today; you can install more at any
time.

Pick your families from
[What each family solves](#what-each-family-solves) above.

Each family's README opens with an **Install & first runs** section — the one
command for that family and a few things to try once it is in:
[setup](/docs/setup/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[security](/docs/security/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[release-management](/docs/release-management/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[pr-management](/docs/pr-management/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[issue](/docs/issue-management/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[repo-health](/docs/repo-health/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[contributor-growth](/docs/contributor-growth/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[utilities](/docs/utilities/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[mentoring](/docs/mentoring/readme#install--first-runs) ·
[pairing](/docs/pairing/readme#install--first-runs)

#### Optional: commit a default set for your teammates

Everything above installs Magpie for **you, on this machine** — nothing is
written to the repository, and your teammates are unaffected.

A project can go one step further and commit a small block to its
`.claude/settings.json` naming the marketplace and three plugins, so anyone who
clones the repo and trusts it arrives with `magpie-setup`, `magpie-utilities`
and `magpie-agent-guard` already enabled. `/magpie-setup` offers to write it —
see [the default set](/docs/setup/marketplaces#claude-code-the-default-set).

**This is entirely optional.** The plugins work in the repo whether or not the
block is committed, and a project that never commits it is not missing
anything: the install you just did is complete. It is a convenience for
teams — nobody has to run the install by hand — not a requirement.

### OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
codex plugin install magpie
```

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Point VS Code's plugin install at the repository URL — it clones the repo
and loads Magpie as an [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification)
package:

```text
https://github.com/apache/magpie
```

This path is not yet live-installed against a running VS Code — see
[Verification status](/docs/setup/marketplaces#verification-status).

### Google Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/apache/magpie
```

This path is not yet live-installed either — see
[Verification status](/docs/setup/marketplaces#verification-status).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The all-in-one `magpie` plugin is not recommended** unless you genuinely
> want every family. It installs all 74 skills and adds **~8.6k always-on
> tokens to every session** — context spent whether or not you invoke a Magpie
> skill that turn — against 0.2–2.0k for a family you picked on purpose.
> Reach for it only when you really do need all ten families, or on Windows
> without symlink support (per-family plugins rely on git symlinks; see the
> [Windows note](/docs/setup/marketplaces#choosing-a-plugin-all-in-one-vs-per-family)).

> [!TIP]
> **Working in IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm or another JetBrains IDE?** There is
> nothing extra to install. A JetBrains IDE hosts an agent rather than
> distributing skills itself, so you run the install above for the agent you
> use inside it — with Claude Code's JetBrains plugin, the same
> `/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie` from the IDE's Claude Code window.
> And you only do it once: plugin state lives in a single user-scope store, so
> a marketplace added in the terminal is already there in the IDE. Details, and
> why JetBrains' own agent Junie is a separate matter, in
> [marketplaces.md](/docs/setup/marketplaces#jetbrains-ides-intellij-idea-pycharm-goland-).

> [!NOTE]
> **Per-family plugins are Claude Code-only** today, for the packaging reason
> recorded in
> [marketplaces.md](/docs/setup/marketplaces#choosing-a-plugin-all-in-one-vs-per-family).
> The three agents above can install only the all-in-one `magpie` plugin — so
> on those, the ~8.6k always-on cost is currently the price of entry. Cursor,
> Kiro, OpenCode, and `microsoft/apm` are covered there too.

## Step 2 — use it

Ask in plain language:

> review PR #5193

> triage the latest security reports

or call a skill by name. A marketplace install namespaces skills under the
**plugin** that provides them, as `/<plugin>:<skill>`:

```text
/magpie-pr-management:triage
/magpie-security:issue-triage
```

With the all-in-one plugin the namespace is just `/magpie:` — e.g.
`/magpie:pr-management-triage`. `/magpie-utilities:list-skills` prints
everything that is installed.

---

## What happens next — the secure isolation setup

Magpie's skills read issues, pre-disclosure security reports, and private
mailing lists. So the first skill worth running is the one that locks the
agent down:

```text
/magpie-setup:isolated-setup-install
```

It walks you through the install interactively and surfaces every sudo,
shell-rc, and settings-file change for approval before applying it. When it
finishes, your agent runs with:

- **A filesystem sandbox** — Bash subprocesses run under Seatbelt (macOS) or
  bubblewrap (Linux) and see only the paths you allow. Your `~/.ssh`,
  `~/.aws`, and tokens are out of reach.
- **A clean environment** — the `claude-iso` wrapper strips host environment
  variables before the agent starts.
- **Visible state** — the status line says whether the sandbox is on, and a
  bold red banner fires before any bypass prompt.

![Sandboxed session: status-line prefix `[sandbox]` rendered green](/docs-assets/session-sandboxed.png)

Green `[sandbox]` in the footer is the steady state. Confirm the whole
install with `/magpie-setup:isolated-setup-verify`, which reports ✓/✗/⚠
for every piece.

## Per user or per project

The marketplace install above is the recommended path, and it is complete —
you can stay on it indefinitely, including
[on a repo that has not adopted Magpie](/docs/setup/personal-use-unadopted-repo)
or [on a team where only some people use it](/docs/setup/mixed-adoption-teams).

| | Who installs it | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| **Marketplace install** (above) | You, per machine | Your agent. Nothing in the repo. |
| **Pinned snapshot install** | The project, once | A committed version pin, project config, and overrides in the repo. |
| **Self-adoption** (`method:local`) | The Magpie checkout itself | Committed symlinks onto the repo's own `skills/`. |

### Fallback — the pinned snapshot install

Use the snapshot install when a marketplace is not an option or not enough:

- your agent has no plugin or marketplace mechanism at all;
- you need the **signed ASF source release** from `dist.apache.org` rather
  than a git clone;
- the project wants every contributor and CI job pinned to **one committed
  version**, with drift detection and project-specific overrides.

It puts a gitignored snapshot plus a committed `.apache-magpie.lock` in the
repo, and wires the skills into *any* agent through `.agents/skills/`:

```text
/magpie-setup install
```

**Skill names differ here.** On the snapshot install a skill is one token —
`/magpie-security-issue-triage`, the skill's directory name — not
`/magpie-security:issue-triage`. There is no plugin namespace; the `magpie-`
prefix is the namespace. See
[Skill names differ by install method](/docs/setup/marketplaces#skill-names-differ-by-install-method).

→ [`setup/install-recipes.md`](/docs/setup/install-recipes) has the
copy-pasteable bootstrap. The two are complementary, not exclusive: pin the
snapshot for the project and keep the marketplace plugin for yourself if you
prefer.

### Working on Magpie itself — self-adoption

Inside a clone of [`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie), the
default is neither of the above: the framework **self-adopts**, linking its own
live `skills/` source so the skills you are editing are the skills that run.

```text
/magpie-setup method:local
```

`/magpie-setup` detects the framework checkout and takes this path by default —
a remote method against it is refused, because snapshotting the framework into
itself would shadow the live source with a stale copy. It fetches nothing: the
`magpie-<skill>` symlinks point at in-repo paths and are **committed**, and
`.apache-magpie.lock` records `method: local` with no URL or ref. Contributors
get it on a fresh clone with no install step at all.

Self-adoption uses the **same single-token names as the snapshot install** —
`/magpie-pairing-self-review`, not `/magpie-pairing:self-review`.
