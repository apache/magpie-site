| **Status** | Proposed. Nothing built. Depends on agreement from the Incubator PMC and ComDev, who would own two of the layers. |
| **Created** | 2026-09-17 |
| **Revised** | 2026-09-18, after IPMC feedback on the proposal thread. The podling value set below was wrong in four places; see [Bodies are per-action, not per-project](#bodies-are-per-action-not-per-project). |
| **Origin** | The question "should podling onboarding move to `apache/incubator`?" — and the discovery that the answer is no, because the thing that should move is not a skill. |

A skill that serves two governance stages does not want splitting. What wants
splitting is **who owns the values it branches on**, and today nobody does:
each project retypes them.

## What is wrong

`committer-onboarding` walks a nominator from a passed vote to a welcomed
committer. It serves both incubating podlings and graduated top-level
projects, and the difference between them is already parameterised:

```yaml
committer_governance_asf_pmc:
  stage: podling | tlp
  whimsy_roster_url: TODO   # .../roster/ppmc/<x>  vs  .../roster/committee/<x>
```

The procedure is one procedure. The branch is data. That much is right.

What is wrong is where the data comes from. `whimsy_roster_url: TODO` is
filled in per project, by hand. So is the PPMC vote bar, and the podling's
private list, and every other value that follows from *being a podling*. This
is knowledge the Incubator PMC holds centrally and every podling copies
separately.

This document's own first draft is the argument for it: writing these values
out from memory produced four wrong ones, including a private-list form the
Incubator stopped using. The corrections are recorded below.

Three consequences, in increasing order of seriousness:

- **Retyping.** Every podling writes the same values.
- **Drift.** When the Incubator changes something, forty podlings are wrong
  and nobody knows which.
- **Graduation is a rewrite.** Moving from podling to TLP should be one line.
  Today it means hand-editing every value the stage implies.

The failure mode this design exists to prevent is the second one. A config
value copied from another body is a snapshot of their policy, and it goes
stale silently.

## Decisions

**Four layers, each owned by whoever knows the answer.**

| Layer | Owner | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Procedure — the skill | Magpie | The steps, in order, and where the decision points are |
| Organization defaults | The organization (`organizations/ASF/`) | ICLA, secretary request, Whimsy, karma — true of every ASF project |
| **Stage overlay** — new | **Incubator PMC** (podling) · **ComDev** (TLP) | What `stage: podling` or `stage: tlp` actually implies |
| Project config | The project | Only what is genuinely this project's |

Resolution is most-specific-wins: **project → stage → organization → framework
default**. A project that needs to differ still can; it just no longer has to
in order to be correct.

**The skill does not move, and does not split.** It stays one procedure with
one branch. Moving it to `apache/incubator` would hand the Incubator PMC
ownership of TLP onboarding, which is not their domain. Splitting it produces
two skills that are ~80% identical and will diverge, in a procedure where
divergence means a committer is onboarded wrongly.

**Each body edits only its own file, in its own repository** — both the
values it owns and, where values are not enough, an override of the shared
procedure. This is the property that makes the design worth building at all. It follows
[`MISSION.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/MISSION.md) — *"Those teams choose whether to contribute
a skill into Magpie or keep it in their own repository and let Magpie install
it by reference — Magpie does not reach into another team's domain on its own
initiative."* A stage overlay is that sentence applied to configuration rather
than to skills.

**Magpie reconciles; neither body needs to know the other exists.** The
Incubator describes podlings. ComDev describes graduated projects. Magpie
resolves the layers and hands the skill one merged view. Neither overlay
references the other, and neither is aware it is one of two.

### What a stage overlay contains

Incubator-owned, illustrative:

```yaml
# organizations/ASF/stages/podling.md — sourced from apache/incubator
stage: podling
pmc_of_record: IPMC       # holds the authority
delegated_body: PPMC      # exercises it day to day
whimsy_roster_url: https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/ppmc/<project>
private_list: private@<project>.apache.org

votes:
  committer:
    list: private@<project>.apache.org
    binding_voters: PPMC members
    rule: at least three +1s, and more +1s than -1s
  release:
    # Two stages. The second one is what publishes.
    - list: dev@<project>.apache.org
      binding_voters: PPMC members
      rule: at least three +1s, and more +1s than -1s
    - list: general@incubator.apache.org
      binding_voters: IPMC members
      rule: at least three +1s, and more +1s than -1s
      publishes: true
```

ComDev-owned, for the other stage: the same keys with TLP values — one PMC,
one vote, `pmc_of_record` and `delegated_body` collapsing to the same body.

Note what is *not* in there: no procedure, no prose, no steps. An overlay is a
value set. That boundary is what stops the layers becoming two forks of the
same document.

#### Bodies are per-action, not per-project

The first draft of this design wrote `governing_body: PPMC` and
`binding_voters: current PPMC members` — one governing body and one set of
binding voters per podling. That is wrong, and not only in its values:

| First draft | Corrected |
|---|---|
| `governing_body: PPMC` | The IPMC is the PMC of record; a PPMC is delegated and is not a PMC |
| `binding_voters: current PPMC members` | Depends on the vote — PPMC members on the podling's own list, IPMC members on `general@` |
| `private_list: private@<project>.incubator.apache.org` | `private@<project>.apache.org` |
| `vote_rule: 3 binding PPMC +1s, no binding veto` | At least three +1s **and** more +1s than -1s |

The first two are a modelling error rather than a typo. A podling has a body
that *holds* authority and a body that *exercises* it, and which one binds
depends on which list the vote is on. A single key per project cannot express
that, so the overlay names the body per action.

This has a consequence for consumers. A skill must ask "who binds *this*
vote?", not "who governs this project?" — `committer-onboarding` reads
`votes.committer`, and the release skills read `votes.release`. A flat
`binding_voters` key would have let a release skill tally a podling's PPMC
votes as binding to publish, which they are not.

The corrections came from Justin Mclean on the proposal thread
(`dev@community.apache.org`, 2026-09-18). They are recorded here rather than
silently applied, because *this design existing at all* is the argument that
values written out from memory by someone outside the owning body go stale or
start wrong — and these started wrong.

### When values are not enough: body-owned overrides

A value set covers the differences that *are* values. It will not cover
everything, and a design that pretends otherwise pushes a body into forking
the skill the moment it stops fitting — which is the outcome this whole
document exists to avoid.

So the same tier carries an **override** as well as a value set. The framework
already has the mechanism and its premise is exactly right:

> An adopter project that needs to modify a framework workflow's behaviour —
> different defaults, an extra step, a skipped step, a different tone — does
> **not** fork the framework […] Instead, they write an **override file**:
> agent-readable markdown that the framework skill consults at run-time.
>
> — [`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](/docs/setup/agentic-overrides)

A body-owned override is that file, owned by a body rather than a project, and
resolved in the same chain. If the Incubator concludes that podling onboarding
needs a step Magpie's procedure does not have — an IPMC notification, a
graduation-readiness check, a different sequence around the PPMC vote — they
add it in their own repository, in a file they own, and every podling picks it
up on the next pin. Nobody opens a pull request against Magpie, and nobody
maintains a second copy of the eighty percent that never diverged.

The lookup chain grows one tier:

```text
project override   .apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md
stage override     sourced from the owning body, pinned      <- new
framework default  the skill as Magpie ships it
```

Most specific wins, as it already does. The existing hard rules carry over
unchanged — an override may not weaken a confirmation gate, and it may not
reach into the framework snapshot.

The important property is that divergence becomes **incremental**. A body that
needs one step changed writes one step, not a skill. If their override grows
until it is effectively a different procedure, that is a strong, visible signal
that the skill should genuinely split — and at that point the split is an
informed decision with evidence behind it, rather than the guess this design
started by rejecting.

#### Worked example: the podling release procedure

The proposal thread asked a second question — whether the Incubator or ComDev
would rather own Magpie's ten `release-*` skills outright. The answer from the
IPMC side was no, and the reasoning is a better fit for this design than the
question was.

Most of the release procedure is identical for podlings and TLPs: cutting the
RC, KEYS, the planning issue, the archive sweep, the audit record. The podling
deltas are narrow and land on five skills:

| Skill | Podling delta |
|---|---|
| `release-vote-draft` | Two-stage vote: PPMC on `dev@`, then IPMC on `general@` |
| `release-vote-tally` | Only IPMC votes bind to publish |
| `release-verify-rc` | `incubating` in archive names; `DISCLAIMER` present |
| `release-promote` | Publishes to `dist/release/incubator/<podling>` |
| `release-announce-draft` | Incubation disclaimer in the announcement |

Moving ten skills to fix five narrow deltas would duplicate the eighty percent
that does not differ — the failure this design rejects for `committer-onboarding`,
restated at family scale.

Two mechanisms already in this document cover it instead:

- **`release-verify-rc`** — the Incubator already publishes `releasecheck`,
  and Magpie already curates it as a pinned ASF source
  (`organizations/ASF/skill-sources.md`, `ref: releasecheck-0.5.1`). A podling
  can install it directly, with or without Magpie. Recommending it in place of
  `release-verify-rc` needs no new mechanism, only documentation.
- **The other four** — body-owned overrides, as above. The Incubator writes
  the podling deltas in its own repository, on its own cadence, and every
  podling picks them up on the next pin.

Note that the release deltas are the per-action bodies again: "PPMC on `dev@`,
IPMC on `general@`, only the second publishes" is `votes.release` doing its
job. The same correction that fixed onboarding is what makes the release
overrides expressible.

### Graduation

```diff
- stage: podling
+ stage: tlp
```

Every value the stage implies swaps with it. Anything the project genuinely
overrode stays overridden, because project beats stage.

## What has to be built

Two mechanisms, neither of which exists:

1. **A stage tier in config resolution.** Today it is organization → project.
   This needs a body-owned tier between them, and a key to select which
   overlay applies.

2. **Sourcing a configuration *fragment* from an external repository.**
   [`skill-sources`](/docs/skill-sources/readme) can redirect a *whole skill*
   (`skills/<name>/source.md`) to an external, pinned source. There is no way
   to say "this configuration block comes from `apache/incubator` at tag X".

   **The trust and pinning half of this already exists, and already points at
   the Incubator.** `organizations/ASF/skill-sources.md` curates
   `apache/incubator` as an ASF source today:

   ```yaml
   - id: apache-incubator
     organization: ASF
     name: "Apache Incubator skills"
     maintainer: "Apache Incubator PMC"
     method: git-tag
     url: https://github.com/apache/incubator
     ref: releasecheck-0.5.1
     commit: 876cf205869a9e12aa55ad070efae65658c8a34e
   ```

   So the IPMC is already a source Magpie consumes from, by tag, with a
   recorded commit — `releasecheck` arrives that way. This design does not ask
   them to become one; it asks them to publish a second, much smaller kind of
   artefact through the arrangement they already have. The missing piece is
   narrowly that a source can currently only supply a whole skill.

The second is the load-bearing one, and it is why this is a design rather than
a patch. Without it, Magpie would *copy* the Incubator's values into its own
tree — which is the drift this design exists to prevent, reintroduced at the
framework level. Whatever is built must let the overlay be pinned to a ref in
the owning body's repository and updated by moving the pin, exactly as a
sourced skill is.

It generalises past onboarding. ComDev's shared data tools have the same
shape: centrally-known values, consumed by many projects, currently copied.

## Alternatives considered

**Move `committer-onboarding` to `apache/incubator`.** Rejected: it serves
TLPs too, so the Incubator PMC would own a procedure for projects outside
their remit. It also inverts the dependency — Magpie would consume its own
contributor-growth family from another PMC's release cadence.

**Split into `podling-onboarding` and `tlp-onboarding`.** Rejected: ~80%
duplicate, and the duplicated part is the substance (ICLA, account request,
karma, welcome). Two copies of a governance procedure drift, and the cost of
drift here is landed on a new committer.

**Leave it as project config and document the values well.** Rejected as the
status quo: it is exactly what produces `whimsy_roster_url: TODO` in every
podling's config. Better documentation makes the retyping more accurate; it
does not stop it, and it does not fix drift.

**Ship the overlays inside Magpie, maintained by us.** Tempting, and cheap,
and wrong. Magpie would be asserting what the Incubator's policy is. When it
changed we would find out late, from a podling that got it wrong. The whole
value is that the body that owns the policy owns the file.

**Put the stage values in `organizations/ASF/organization.md`.** Rejected: one
file cannot have two owners. The ASF organization file is ASF-common; podling
policy is the IPMC's and TLP policy is ComDev's. Merging them would make every
edit a cross-PMC negotiation, which is the thing being avoided.

## Risks

- **It needs two other PMCs to agree.** Neither is obliged to own a file for
  Magpie's benefit. If either declines, the fallback is the status quo for
  that stage, not a broken framework — the layer is optional by construction.
  The ask is smaller for the Incubator, who already publish `releasecheck`
  through the curated source above, than for ComDev, for whom this would be a
  first.
- **A pinned overlay can go stale too**, just visibly rather than silently:
  the pin names a ref and a date. That is the improvement, not a cure.
- **Two overlays invite a third.** The tier should stay narrow —
  organizational *stage*, not arbitrary grouping — or it becomes a second
  project-config layer with no owner.
- **A body override can drift from the skill it overrides.** An override
  written against one version of a procedure may quietly stop matching it, and
  the framework's existing reconciliation-on-upgrade flow will have to cover
  the new tier, not only the project one.
