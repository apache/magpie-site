| **Status** | Proposed. |
| **Scope** | The `contributor-growth` family: a penalty in `automated-contributions.md`, a new `tools/contributor-metrics` tool, two new skills (`calibrate`, `candidate-screen`), a shared `community-signals.md` used by `nomination` and `contributor-to-committer`, a new `tools/chat` contract with a Slack adapter, and a hand-off from `/magpie-setup config`. |

## What is wrong

An adopter used the family to surface committer and `<governance-body>` candidates, calibrating the thresholds by hand from the project's own past nomination decisions.
The run worked well enough to be useful and showed five gaps:

1. **No calibration path.**
   Thresholds are either framework defaults or numbers a maintainer types in.
   Deriving them from the project's past decisions — the only defensible source — took a manual, one-off analysis.
2. **Pushed-back automated work still scores.**
   `automated-contributions.md` discounts an item that drew maintainer pushback to `0.25`, and one closed after pushback to `0`, but never below zero.
   A contributor with many such items still accumulates count, and one surfaced as a near-candidate on that basis.
3. **Only GitHub is measured.**
   The skills name mailing-list presence and release testing as factors, and past deferrals cite them most often, yet nothing collects them; Step 3 of `nomination` only asks the nominator.
4. **Public community conduct is invisible.**
   Whether a candidate's public activity helps users and the project, or consists of unconstructive complaint, is left entirely to the nominator's memory.
5. **No multi-candidate output.**
   Every skill assesses one handle.
   The screening across all contributors, and the per-candidate evidence the `<governance-body>` asked for (which areas, in what share), had to be assembled ad hoc.

The same feedback also asked that *issues filed* be supporting evidence rather than a required floor, and that triaging other people's issues count as a positive signal.

## Decisions

- **The output is a floor to help notice candidates, never a decision.**
  Every report says so; decisions remain the `<governance-body>`'s.
- **Deterministic counting lives in a tool.**
  Calibration measures on the order of a hundred past nominees across two windows, and screening measures dozens of contributors; that is code, not model passes (Principle 6).
  The model keeps the judgement calls: restatement confirmation, thread classification, community-item classification, and the narrative.
- **Community signals are evidence plus a separate indicator.**
  They never change activity counts or threshold pass/fail.
- **Off-project sources are limited to accounts the candidate linked themselves**, and to posts that mention the project.
  No open web search for a person's name or handle.
- **Identity is confirmed or not used.**
  A cross-platform match counts only when a commit email, the organization's people directory, a chat profile, or the maintainer confirms it.
- **The report is delivered to a private repository only**, verified private through the API before anything is written.
  A secret gist is not private — anyone with its URL can read it — so it is not an option.
- **Real names are used when verified**, never guessed (see [Real names](#real-names)).
- **Calibration working data never leaves the session scratch directory.**
  Only the resulting numbers, and the date, reach configuration.

## Components

### 1. Pushback penalty

A new key in `contributor-nomination-config.md`:

```yaml
automated_pushback_penalty: 0.25   # 0 restores the discount-only behaviour
```

It applies to each item in class `P` (drew pushback on automated content) or `C` (closed after such pushback).
Class `R` (restatement) is low-value, not pushed back on, and is not penalised.

Per count: `adjusted = Σ weights − penalty × (P + C items)`, floored at `0`.
With the defaults, a closed-after-pushback PR nets `−0.25` and a pushed-back merged PR nets `0`.
The penalty is applied once per PR or issue thread, not per comment, so one incident with a long exchange counts once.

The brief shows raw, discounted, penalty, and adjusted side by side.
The existing reporting rules stand: describe flagged items factually, do not label the contributor or speculate about tools, do not reproduce the pushback text, and state that pushback is a negative signal to weigh, not a disqualification.

### 2. `tools/contributor-metrics`

A Python project run with `uv`, `**Capability:** substrate:analytics`, calling `gh` through a subprocess as the other GitHub tools do.

**Input:** one or more handles, `--end <date>`, `--months 6,12`, `<upstream>`, the area-label prefix (config `area_label_prefix`, default `area:`), the maintainer roster used for pushback attribution, `automated_pushback_phrases`, and the weight and penalty keys.

**Output**, one JSON object per handle and window:

- raw and adjusted counts: PRs merged, reviews, substantive reviews, comment threads, issues filed, and **issues triaged** — labelling, reproducing, or answering issues opened by someone else;
- **area breakdown:** per area, merged PRs and reviews as counts and as a share of the candidate's total;
- a monthly timeline;
- every flagged item with its link and class.

The tool flags pushback *candidates* deterministically — a maintainer comment containing a known phrase — but `automated-contributions.md` requires matching on meaning (negations, retractions, remarks about someone else's content), so the calling skill confirms or rejects each candidate.
Restatement needs judgement too and stays entirely in the skill, within the existing inspection budget; the skill hands the confirmed classes back to the tool for the arithmetic.

Results are cached per repository, handle, window, pushback phrases and roster under `$TMPDIR`, so `calibrate` and `candidate-screen` do not refetch; weights are applied at scoring time and never cached, and `--refresh` refetches.

### 3. `calibrate` skill

A new skill in the family, `capability:stats`.
`/magpie-setup config` offers it when the family is installed and thresholds are blank; setup hands off and implements none of it.

**Step 0** runs the privacy-llm gate — the skill reads `<private-list>`, so an unapproved model in the stack is a hard stop — and the mail-archive backend health probe.

**Inputs:** `since:` (default five years), `holdout:<date>` (nothing dated after it is read), `exclude-thread:<id>` (repeatable), `windows:6,12`, and a recency half-life (default two years).

**Flow:**

1. **Find nominations.**
   Search `<private-list>` through the `mail-archive` contract for discussion, vote, and result threads on committer and `<governance-body>` nominations.
   From each thread the model extracts a structured row only: nominee, target, vote date, outcome (elected, deferred, withdrawn), and a coarse deferral category (narrow focus, little mailing-list presence, short tenure, other).
   No quotes and no member opinions are retained.
2. **Resolve handles.**
   Match nominees to GitHub handles from the thread, the roster, and commit history.
   Unresolved nominees are listed for the maintainer; none is guessed.
3. **Measure** each nominee with `contributor-metrics` (end date = vote date) and with the mailing-list rows of [community signals](#4-community-signals).
4. **Propose floors.**
   Per metric and target, show the recency-weighted p25 and median of elected nominees beside the median of deferred ones, split into recent and older eras, and propose a floor.
   A metric that does not separate elected from deferred is proposed as *evidence only*.
5. **Holdout check** (optional).
   Screen the current window with the proposed floors and list who surfaces, for the maintainer to compare with any live discussion; the skill never reads that discussion.
6. **Write configuration.**
   Propose a diff to `contributor-nomination-config.md` and `committer-readiness.md` holding only the numbers, the evidence-only markers, and `calibrated_on: <date>` — no derivation, no names.
   The default target is `.apache-magpie-local/`; the committed overrides layer is offered as an alternative.
   Applied on confirmation.

The per-nominee working table stays in the session scratch directory and the skill offers to delete it at the end.
Other skills suggest recalibrating when `calibrated_on` is older than twelve months.

### 4. Community signals

A shared `nomination/community-signals.md`, used by `nomination` and `contributor-to-committer` at their Step 3.
Step 3 becomes *collect, then ask the nominator to confirm or add*, instead of *ask*.

**Sources**, each resolved from project configuration; an unconfigured or unreachable source is reported as *not collected*:

| Source | Through | Rows it adds |
|---|---|---|
| `<dev-list>`, `<users-list>` | `mail-archive` contract, public archives | threads started, replies, replies to user questions, **release testing** (vote-thread replies showing testing) |
| Project chat | new `tools/chat` contract — Slack adapter over the Slack MCP, public channels only; Discord as a tracked extension point | messages, answers to other people's questions |
| GitHub Discussions | `gh` GraphQL | answers, accepted answers |
| Self-linked accounts | the candidate's GitHub profile links (blog, social accounts) that link back to that profile | posts in the window that mention the project |

No direct messages, no private channels, and the candidate is never contacted.

**Classification**, per item, by the model: *constructive*, *neutral*, or *unconstructive*.
Constructive covers user support, advocacy, talks and tutorials, and **criticism that gives reasons or a proposal**.
Unconstructive is reserved for complaint without substance, hostility, or disparaging people.
Disagreement alone is never unconstructive.
Each item carries a link and a one-line factual summary; no long quotes, and no personal details of anyone else in the message.

**Community indicator:** each constructive item `+1`, each unconstructive item `− community_negative_weight` (default `1`).
Rendered as `community: +12 / −1 (net +11)` beside the threshold table, with the items listed.
It never alters activity counts or threshold pass/fail.

All collected content is external data under the repository's external-content rule; a message that tries to instruct the agent is surfaced and ignored.

### 5. `candidate-screen` skill

A new skill in the family, `capability:stats`.

**Inputs:** `target:committer|pmc|both` (default `both`), `window:6m`, `end:<date>`.
`report_repo` and `report_path` come from `contributor-nomination-config.md`.

**Step 0:** `gh api repos/<report_repo> --jq .private` must be `true`, or the skill refuses.
It shows the repository's collaborators for the maintainer to confirm the audience before anything is written.

**Flow:**

1. **Pool.**
   Committer target: everyone with a merged PR in the window who is not a committer.
   `<governance-body>` target: committers not in it.
   Rosters from the Apache Projects MCP where reachable, else `pmc-roster.md`.
2. **Pre-filter** deterministically on cheap search counts — merged PRs and reviewed PRs, the only counts cheap enough for a large pool: keep anyone at or above `screen_prefilter_ratio` (default `0.5`) of either floor, ignoring floors of `0`.
   The `<governance-body>` pool is small and is not pre-filtered.
   Everyone dropped is logged with their counts.
3. **Measure** survivors with `contributor-metrics`.
   The shortlist is everyone missing at most `shortlist_max_missing` (default `2`) floors, evidence-only metrics excluded.
   Community signals are collected for the shortlist only.
4. **Write** two to three paragraphs per shortlisted candidate: what they built and where, their review, mentoring, and community work, and factual flags (automated-work pushback, single-area or single-vendor concentration where known).
   Every claim links to its evidence.

**Report**, one markdown file at `<report_path>/<date>-candidate-screen.md`:

- header: window, thresholds and `calibrated_on`, sources collected and not collected, and the floor-not-decision note;
- summary table: candidate, target, floors met, community net, automated-work flags;
- per candidate: area table (area, PRs, reviews, share), threshold table (raw, discounted, penalty, adjusted), community items, and the paragraphs;
- *considered, not shortlisted:* handles with counts only.

**Delivery:** the maintainer reviews the local file first; on confirmation the privacy check and the collaborator list are run again, and only then is the report committed through `gh api …/contents` with the payload in a file.
The report contains **no `@`-mentions** — plain handles with profile links — so no candidate is notified.
Nothing is posted anywhere else.

## Real names

Reports, briefs, and any drafted message to the `<governance-body>` show a person as **Real Name (`handle`)** when the name comes from a verifiable source, in this order:

1. the organization's people directory (for ASF, the Apache Projects MCP `get_person`) when the person has an account there;
2. the `name` field of their GitHub profile;
3. the author name on their commits to `<upstream>`, when consistent across commits.

When sources disagree, the directory wins and the disagreement is noted.
When none yields a name, the handle is used alone.
A name is never inferred from an email address, a handle, or a mailing-list display name that is not tied to the handle by a confirmed identity.
Email addresses are never included.

## Testing

Each new skill ships an eval suite under `tools/skill-evals/evals/<skill>/`, and `contributor-metrics` ships fixture tests with recorded `gh` JSON and no network.

| Unit | Cases |
|---|---|
| Penalty | weight, penalty, and floor arithmetic; once-per-thread; penalty `0` reproduces current output |
| `contributor-metrics` | area shares; triage detection; `R` candidates emitted, not decided |
| `calibrate` | synthetic archive of ~10 nominations → expected rows; a thread after `holdout` is never read; a non-separating metric is proposed evidence-only; output diff carries no names |
| Community signals | unconfirmed identity excluded; reasoned criticism classified constructive; injection in a message treated as data |
| `candidate-screen` | public `report_repo` refused; no `@`-mentions in output; shortlist boundaries; pre-filtered person appears in the dropped log |
| Real names | directory beats profile; no name inferred from an email local part |

## Rollout

Five PRs, in order, each independently useful:

1. Pushback penalty.
2. `tools/contributor-metrics`, with `contributor-to-committer` and `nomination` switched to it.
3. `calibrate`, and the `/magpie-setup config` hand-off.
4. Community signals and `tools/chat` with the Slack adapter; Discord tracked as an extension point.
5. `candidate-screen`, and the real-names rule applied across the family's renderers.

An adopter then recalibrates and screens with its own configuration; that run is not part of the framework change.

## Risks

- **Identity mismatch** puts someone else's activity in a candidate's file.
  Mitigated by confirm-or-exclude matching and the *possible match, not used* list.
- **Chilling legitimate dissent.**
  Mitigated by classifying reasoned criticism as constructive and keeping the indicator out of pass/fail.
- **Thresholds read as a decision rule.**
  Mitigated by the floor-not-decision note on every output and the evidence-only markers.
- **Private material leaking.**
  Calibration data stays in scratch; the report goes only to an API-verified private repository; nothing is posted publicly; no `@`-mentions.
- **Chat and archive coverage gaps** make quieter channels look like absence.
  Mitigated by reporting every source as collected or not collected.
